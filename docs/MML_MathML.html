<h1>MathML in JSim</h1>



<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p> MathML is a W3C standard specification for describing mathematics
content and presentation markup.  As well as being useful in itself,
MathML is used as part of the <a href="MML_CellML.html">CellML</a> and <a
href="MML_SBML.html">SBML</a> model specifications.  This document
discusses MathML export from JSim.  JSim
currently supports import of MathML only when it is embedded in CellML or
SBML. </p>

<h2>  <a name="basic">MathML Basics</a></h2>

<p>    MathML documents may specify either content or presentation markup.
Content markup describes the underlying mathematic structure of a
mathematical expression.  Presentation markup describes the graphical
layout of mathematical symbols.  For example, the underlying content 
"A multiplied by B" might be presented in any of the 
following manners:</p>

<pre>
      A * B
      A x B
      A . B
      AB
      (A)(B)
</pre>

<p> Content markup is most often used mathematical processing packages 
or documents, such as CellML and SBML.  Presentation markup is used by 
graphics packages to produce publication quality equation graphics.</p>

<p> A complete description of MathML is beyond the scope of this 
document.  Those interested in the reasoning behind MathML design, and 
specifics of the implementation should consult the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/Math">MathML home page</a></p>

<h2>  <a name="scope">JSim MathML Scope and Usage</a></h2>

<p> JSim generates MathML content markup for MML models as an XHTML 
document with one equation per paragraph.  The equations are in the form 
of MathML content markup.  This document will be rendered properly in 
MathML-enabled browsers after the addition of an appropriate stylesheet 
(see <a href="#graphic">below</a> ).  Most MML equations translate to 
MathML properly.  There are certain limitations to models contains 
events, functions and procedures.  For further information, see <a 
href="#details">Implementaton Details</a>.</p>

<p> You can export MathML from either the <a href="User_Ref.html">JSim 
GUI</a> or <a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a> .  In the JSim GUI, 
select "View MathML" from the View menu in the model's Debug tab.  In 
jsbatch, use the -mathml switch:</p>

<pre>
      jsbatch -f test.mod -omathml &gt; test.xml
</pre>

<p> Both options above require successful model compilation.</p>

<p> There is currently no JSim options to tailor MathML output.  Any 
needed output editing must be done in external packages, such as text, 
XML or MathML editors.</p>

<p> Note that generated models compiled with "unit correction on;" will 
include conversion factors in the MathML output.  If you don't want to 
include such factors, modify the MML to "unit correction off;" and 
recompile.  We realize this approach is rather awkward, and will work 
out a simpler methodology in the future.</p>

<h2>  <a name="graphic">Creating Graphics from JSim MathML Output</a></h2>

<p> The generated .xml output requires a style sheet for proper graphic 
rendering.  A style sheet provides information to a MathML-enabled 
browser on how to render MathML. See the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/Overview-tech.html">MathML XSL 
Overview</a> for a specific example.</p>

<p>    Example usage: Download mathml.xsl and related files from the above
link, place them in the same directory as the output .xml file,  and 
insert the following as the 2nd line of the .xml:</p>

<pre>
      &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="mathml.xsl"?&gt;
</pre>

<p>    The .xml should now render passable graphics in an MathML-enabled 
browser.</p>

<h2>  <a name="details">Implementation Details</a></h2>

<p>    This section describes details and quirks of the MML to MathML
conversion process.</p>

<p>    MML "when" clauses are translated to MathML "condition" tags.</p>

<p>    MML <a href="MML_Events.html">events</a> are not translated to MathML.  These
constructs are procedural (rather than mathematical) and, as such, have
no obvious counterpart in MathML.</p>

<p>    Code definition blocks and library references in MML <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">functions and
procedures</a> are not translated to MathML (see events
above).  However, calls to functions, as part of an mathematical
equation, are translated.</p>

<p>The integral operator "integral(t=t.min to t.max, u)"
is not yet translated properly to MathML.  However, the form
"integral(u@t)" is.</p>
