<h1>Introduction to JSim RTML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  <a name="intro">Preface</a></h2>

<p> JSim Run-Time Markup Language (RTML) is an XML dialect that 
specifies the run-time appearance of a compiled model in terms of pages 
and menus. There are two RTML documents associated with any JSim model: 
the default RTML and the custom RTML.  The default RTML is generated 
internally and produces the familiar "Inputs", "Outputs", "Solvers" and 
"Function generator" pages in a model's "Run time" tab.  The optional 
custom RTML may be created by a model writer to improve the JSim user's 
run-time experience by providing a nested set of pages, tables, diagrams 
and menus that make the model easier to navigate and understand.  This 
document provides a starting point for adding RTML to a JSim model.</p>

<h2> <a name="start">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p> Most RTML writers will find it useful to look at some examples 
before seriously examining at the RTML specification.  You may view the 
default RTML for a model via the "Export default RTML..." item in the 
"Pages" menu of a model's "Run Time" tab (the model must be compiled to 
do this).  More complex examples of custom RTML may found in the project 
files distributed with the <a href="User_Fpack.html">JSim Fortran 
Package (fpack)</a> . For such models, the "Export custom RTML..." item 
in the "Pages" menu above will allow you to view the custom RTML.</p>

<p> Custom RTML, created is accordance with the <a 
href="MML_RTML_Ref.html">RTML Reference Manual</a> , may be associated 
with a JSim model via the "Import custom RTML..." item in the "Pages" 
menu above.</p>

<p> Alternatively, <a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a> users may use 
the "-rtml" switch.  In the following example, the custom RTML 
"spiffy.rtml" is loaded into the model "axon" within old.proj, and saved 
in new.proj:</p>

<pre>
      jsbatch -f old.proj -rtml axon:spiffy.rtml -oproj &gt; new.proj
</pre>

<h2>  <a name="image">Model Images</a></h2>

<p> Custom RTML often uses <strong>image</strong> elements to provide 
graphic images within pages.  <strong>image</strong> elements contain 
the name of the image rather than the actual image data.  Image data is 
stored in a model's image set, which may be viewed and edited within a 
model's "Images" tab.  Each image must be assigned a name by which it is 
known in RTML.  That name may not contain spaces or punctuation.  Image 
formats GIF, JPEG and PNG are currently supported.  Other formats may be 
available in the future.  The JSim GUI supports standard 
import/export/rename/delete functions for images within the image 
set.</p>

<p> Alternatively, jsbatch users may load images into a project file via 
the -img switch.  In the following example, the image leg.gif are loaded 
into the example1 axon model with name Leg:</p>

<pre>
      jsbatch -f old.proj -img axon.images.Leg:leg.gif -oproj &gt; new.proj
</pre>

<p> The -rtml and multiple -img switches may be used to load externally 
generated custom RTML and associated images with a single jsbatch 
command.</p>
