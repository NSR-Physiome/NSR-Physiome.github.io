<h1>The JSim Sandbox</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    JSim models allow for embedding of source code in Java, C and (eventually)
other languages using a feature called <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">Functions and
Procedures</a> (F&P).  F&P give modelers great flexibility in
how they formulate model calculations, at the cost of opening a potential
security hole.  Using these same constructs, an unscrupulous person could
embed malicious code into a JSim model or project file and pass it on to an
unsuspecting JSim user.  The user's account and/or computer system might then
be harmed by running such a model under JSim.  The JSim sandbox is a 
mechanism for safely running untrusted model code.</p>

<h2>  <a name="over">Sandbox Overview</a></h2>
<p>The JSim sandbox is a protected
environment for running Java F&P that prevents potentially dangerous
operations (such as deleting arbitrary files).  Complete details on
prohibited operations are found in the <a href="#tech">technical details</a> 
secion of this document.</p>
<p>    The sandbox has two user-configurable parameters:</p>

<ol>
<li> READPATH - readable directories available to the application;</li>
<li> WRITEPATH - writeable/deletable directories available to the 
application.</li>

</ol>
<p>    The default sandbox is very restrictive,  prohibiting, for instance, 
saving project files in their normal locations.  The user may augment
the default READPATH and WRITEPATH on the command line in jsim or jsbatch.</p>
<h2>  <a name="active">Activating the Sandbox</a></h2>
<p>    The sandbox is activated in the <strong>-sandbox</strong> switch::</p>
<p>    -sandbox [ WRITEPATH [ READPATH ] ]</p>
<p>    Each PATH is a list of files or directories separated by your 
operating system's path separation character (colon on MacOS and Linux,
semi-colon on Windows).  User may specify no paths,  the WRITEPATH only or
both paths.  READPATH automatically contains WRITEPATH so path elements
need not be entered twice.</p>
<p>    The sandbox switch is available in the jsim, jsbatch and jsserver
programs.  jsserver behaves slightly differently that the others in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sandbox is active by default.  It may be disabled (<strong>NOT 
RECOMMENDED</strong>) via the <strong>-nosandbox</strong> switch;</li>
<li>READPATH and WRITEPATH may not be specified on the command line.</li>

</ul>
<h2>  <a name="usage">Usage Recommendations</a></h2>
<p>    NSR recommends the following safety practices as standard:</p>

<ol>
<li> Running models developed by yourself or trusted collaborators does
not require the sandbox.</li>
<li> If you receive a model or project file from an untrusted source, it
should be run in the sandbox.  If working in the sandbox is inconvenient,
you should examine the code to make sure there is nothing malicious in it
before running it outside the sandbox.</li>
<li> It is always a poor idea to run JSim (or any other complex user
program) from a privileged account (that is, Administrator or root).</li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="tech">Technical Details</a></h2>
<p>    Activating the sandbox causes the following changes in program 
behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>The default JSIMPATH does not contains the program launch directory 
(.);</li>
<li>The default READPATH in command-line applications (jsbatch,
jsserver) contains JAVAHOME, JSIMHOME and JSIMPATH;</li>
<li>The default READPATH in GUI applications (jsim) contains all files;</li>
<li>The default WRITEPATH is the work directory for the session;</li>
<li>The default READPATH and WRITEPATH may be augmented via the -sandbox
switch in jsim and jsbatch;</li>
<li>reading files outside READPATH is prohibited;</li>
<li>writing or deleting files outside WRITEPATH is prohibited;</li>
<li>C language source F&P is prohibited;</li>
<li>Loading native libraries from the session work directory is 
prohibited;</li>
<li>Executing system commands (such as "rm -Rf /") is prohibited;</li>
<li>Opening network connections is allowed only to the local host,
a remote RMI server/client host (if any), and the <strong>-userurl</strong> host
(if any).</li>

</ul>
