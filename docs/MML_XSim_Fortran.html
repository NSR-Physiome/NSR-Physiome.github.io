    <h1>Writing XSim-style models for JSim in Fortran</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document describes how to create the free-standing computational
model code for an XSim-style model under JSim.  It assumes you understand
the <a href="MML_XSim_Intro.html">Introduction to XSim-style models under JSim</a> and
are familiar with building Fortran programs on your system.</p>
<h2>  Contents</h2>

<h2>  <a name="code">Writing appropriate Fortran code</a></h2>
<p>    Fortran model code, conforming the XSIM API for Fortran must be created.  
This main source file will have extension .f or .F.  The compiled version
will have extension .o. It is assumed you have installed a Fortran compiler
on your system and know how to operate it. The API is given below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The file "scparf.h" in directory $JSIMHOME/$OS/include must be copied
or included in your Fortran. This code defines the REAL P array as a common
block.</li>
<li>The code must have SUBROUTINE ENTRY points for simini, simlop and
simend (these are not optional, as in XSim).  simini is called once at the
beginning of the program.  simlop is called once for each independent
variable (usually time) step.  simend is called once at the end of the
run.</li>
<li>A block of 4 P array locations are reserved for the independent 
variable.  Sequentially,  these values represent the minimum, maximum,
current and step increment.  Traditionally,  the current value is at 
location 130,  however it may be anywhere so long as the "ivar" 
of the associated MML wrapper has the appropriate location.</li>
<li>Warning messages from the model should call scwmsg(S), where S is a
CHARACTER* variable containing the warning message.  These messages will
be displayed in the JSim GUI, but will not affect the run.  Similarly,
fatal errors should call scfmsg(S),  which will cause JSim to terminate
the model run.</li>

</ul>
<h2>  <a name="wrap">Wrapping your model code with jsxwrap</a></h2>
<p>    The program jsxwrap wraps a Fortran object and associated libraries 
in a native library that can be utilized by JSim.  The usage is:
<pre>
      jsxwrap -f modelName objects libraries
</pre>
</p>
<p>    The "-f" switch indicates the objects implement the XSim Fortran API
for JSim.  </p>
<p>    jsxwrap required you have installed a version of gcc compatible with the
JSim distribution.  gcc must be installed for jsxwrap to run, and the objects
and libraries specified must be compatible with the JSim distribution (see
caveats below).  Upon successful completion, jsxwrap will print a message 
giving the name of the native library generated.</p>
<h2>  <a name="example">A simple example</a></h2>
<p>    Here is an example of a single source Fortran model (demo.F) that 
requires the C math library.  The example assumes you're on Linux:
<pre>
      g77 -I $JSIMHOME/linux/include -c demo.o demo.F
      jsxwrap -f demo demo.o -lm
</pre>
</p>
<p>    The generated file will be libjsxdemo.so.</p>
<h2>  <a name="caveats">Some caveats</a></h2>
<p>    Here are some current problems we intent to fix shortly:</p>

<ul>
<li>jsxwrap is currently available only for Linux and MacIntosh
distributions.  A Windows version is under development.  Users of the JSim
source distribution may use jsxwrap.db.</li>
<li>Warning and fatal messages are written to the 
console rather that into the JSim project window, and fatal messages 
are not fatal.  </li>
<li>Must get users more information on gcc compatibility.</li>

</ul>
