<h2> <a name="simple">A Simple MML Model </a></h2>

<p> Below is a simple model using trig functions: </p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Intro/intro_alg.proj"); ?>

<p> Items of note:</p>
<ul>

<li>An MML model is a set of nested components.  There must be one 
top-level
component, in this case of type "math".  This document will consider only
top-level components of type math (for details, see <a
href="MML_Templates.html">templates</a>). The name given the math
component (here "main") is inconsequential to JSim operation.  Content of
the math component is delimited by curly braces {}.</li>

<li>Inside the math component are variable declarations and
equations. A variable must be declared before it is used in an equation.
Variables types used here are of type "realDomain" and "real".
</li>

<li>A realDomain represents an independent variable, typically time or 
space. Each realDomain (here "t") contains subvariables "min" (minimum 
value), "max" (maximum value), "delta" (grid point separation) and "ct" 
(number of grid points).  When this model runs, "t" will be calculated 
as a regularly spaced grid.  To be calculable, the model writer must <a 
href="#constraints">constrain</a> 3 of the 4 subvariables. Note that 
subvariables are separated by a period (e.g. "t.min").</li>

<li>A "real" variable represents a either constant or a dependent 
variable (dependent upon realDomains),  
whose value during a
single model run varies
over its declared realDomains.  Here "amp" and "period" are declared
without realDomains so they have a unique value during a
single model run,  while "u", "v" and "w" are declared with realDomain 
"t" so their values will vary with those of "t". See <a href="MML_realConsts.html">
Variable constants</a> for more information concerning variables with no 
domain dependencies such as "amp" an "period".</li>

<li>Variable names must be alpha-numeric (including underscore) and start
with a letter.  For technical reasons, they may not start with the letters
"JS" in any capitalization or contain two successive underscores.  
Variables names are case-sensitive, as is MML in general.</li>

<li>MML algebraic syntax is largely intuitive. The constant "PI" and the
functions "sin()"  and "cos()" are built into JSim.  See <a
href="MML_Ref.html#algebra">here</a> for more information, including
a complete list of built-in functions.</li>

<li>Spacing (spaces, tabs and new-lines) does not affect MML semantics.  
Single line commentary may be added after double-slashes (//).  Extended
C-style comments (/* */) are also supported.</li>

<li>Many older models contain the first line "JSim v1.1".  This syntax is
still supported, but not longer recommended.</li>

</ul>

<h2> <a name="ode">Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</a> </h2>

<p> ODEs are used in research and education for models ranging from
very simple to exceedingly complex.  A simple MML model of exponential 
decay
using an ODE is as follows:</p> 
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Intro/intro_ode.proj"); ?>

<p>To be
solvable by JSim,  an ODE variable must have two  <a 
href="#constraints">constraints</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li> an initial condition (IC) that sets the initial value of the 
variable using the "when" clause;</li>
<li> an ODE state equation relating the variable's derivative to the
variable itself or other model varibles.</li>
</ol>

<p> Note that MML uses the colon (:) operator to represent
differentiation. See <a href="MML_ODE.html">Using ODEs in MML</a> for more
information.</p>

<h2> <a name="units">Physical Units</a> </h2>

<p> MML allows (but does not require) defining physical units (e.g.
m/sec^2) for variables.  Along with making the model easier to
read, this allows JSim to perform integrity checks that catch
common errors, thus reducing debugging time.  Two related issues are 
involved:<p>
<ol>
<li>Inserting conversion factors. For example, when adding centimeters
to millimeters,  one variable must be adjusted by a factor of 10;</li>
<li>Detecting illegal constructs. For example, adding meters/second
to meters/second^2 is fundamentally incorrect.
</ol>

<p> When JSim compiles a model containing the optional "unit
correction on" clause,  appropriate conversion factors are inserted into 
constructs of the 1st sort,  while constructs of the 2nd sort generate
a compilation error.  Consider the model:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Intro/intro_unit.proj"); ?>

<p>Items of note:</p>

<ul>

<li> The "unit conversion on" clause enables JSim unit checking.  
"nsrunit" is JSim's distributed unit file that is recommended, 
and sufficient for 
most purposes.  Model writers may define additional units, if desired,
or even use an entirely separate file of unit definitions.</li>

<li> In this simple case, the conversion factor inserted for the "s3"  
equation is fairly easy to see.  However in large models, conversion
factors are tedious and difficult to keep track of.  They also clutter up
the code, for example 1 faraday = 96485.341 coulomb.</li>

<li> The formulation above discourages some common typos.  For example, if
the parentheses in the "s3" equation were mistakenly omitted, JSim would 
reject the
model due to unit imbalance. Our experience is that errors of this
general form (although more subtle) are disturbingly common in papers
submitted to professional journals, presumably due to a lack of automated
unit checking tools such as JSim. <li>

<li> See <a href="MML_Units.html">Using Physical Units in MML</a> for
further infomation.</li>
</ul>

<h2> <a name="extern"> Driving Data and Test Signals </a> </h2>

<p>Many scientific analyses require driving model inputs with
experimentally measured data or idealized external test signals.  JSim's
approach is to provide these at run-time, rather than to encode them
directly in MML.  This allows easy switching back and forth between
various driving functions at run-time.  In MML, the "extern" declaration
is used to label variables that will be supplied externally via the
run-time environment.  The following MML models the concentration in a
stirred tank whose inflow is supplied externally:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Intro/intro_extern.proj"); ?>

<h2> <a name="parms"> Parameters and Parameter Sets </a> </h2>

<p> When JSim compiles an MML model,  it classifies variables as
either "input" or "output":
<ul>
<li>Variables set equal to numeric constants in MML (e.g. t.min, t.max,
t.delta, F and V in the above model)
are classified as inputs;</li>
<li>Variables declared "extern" (e.g. Cin 
in the above model) are classified as inputs;</li>
<li>All other variables are classified as outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p> JSim model "parameters" are values that affect model calculations that
the user may alter without model recompilation.  There are 3 types of
parameters:</p>

<ol>
<li>MML variables classified as "inputs" above;</li>
<li>numeric solver controls, e.g. which ODE solver algorithm to use
<a href="Solver_ODE_Guide.html">(more info)</a>;</li>
<li>function generator controls, e.g. the amplitude of a test signal
<a href="User_Fgen.html">(more info)</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p> A collection of values for all the parameters in a JSim model is
called a "parameter set". The values generated during a model run reflect
both the model's MML code (which provides default parameter values) and
the model's "current parameter set".  The JSim GUI allows users to save
and restore distinct parameter sets for modeling varying experimental
conditions (e.g. "baseline", "elevated heart rate").  See <a
href="User_ParSets.html">JSim Parameter Sets</a> for further info.</p>

<p><strong>New User Warning:</strong> Values in the current parameter set are
preserved between compiles.  This usually saves modelers work, because
most editing is the fine-tuning of model calculations, however it can
cause a confusing scenario for new users. When an MML model is first
compiled, the default values (e.g. V=20 in the above model) are loaded
into the current parameter set.  If you were to modify the MML to V=25 and
recompile, the value shown in the JSim GUI after recompilation would still
be 20, a value restored from the current parameter set.  The compilation
has altered V's default value to 25 (which you can see by selecting
"Revert to model defaults" from the ParSet menu), but not its current
value.  This behaviour is somewhat controversial and is further discussed
<a href="User_ParSets.html#controversy"> here</a>.</p>

<h2> <a name="constraints"> Understanding Constraints </a> </h2>

<p class="crush"> MML is a declarative language, not a procedural one.  
MML models primarily consist of</p>

<ul class="crush">
<li>declarations of physical units;</li>
<li>declarations of variables;</li>
<li>declarations of constraints on those variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common type of constraints are mathematical equations. 
Consider the following:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Intro/intro_constraints.proj"); ?>

<p class="crush">Notes:</p>
<ul class="crush">
<li>This model will calculate a=5, b=4, c=9.</li>
<li>The order equations are declared in MML does not affect
the results.  Any reordering of eqns 1, 2 and 3 would produce the
same results.</li>
<li>Equations do not necessarily imply calculation of the left-hand side
from the right-hand side (as they do in procedural languages
such as Fortran, C, Java).</li>
</ul>

<p>"extern" is another type of constraint.  Substituting the following
for eqn 3 in the above model would require the JSim user to specify a
value for "a" before the model can run:</p>
<pre>extern a;</pre>

<p>Understanding constraints is important because JSim requires all model
variables to be completely constrained, that is, it ensures there is no
ambiguity in the model calculations.  If any one of the 3 equations in the
above model were omitted, compilation would abort with a "model
underconstrained" error message.  Alternatively, adding a 4th equation
such as </p>
<pre>b=6  // eqn 4</pre>
<p> would cause compilation abort with a "model 
overconstrained"
error message.  This may seem needlessly picky, but it is actually an
advantage.  This approach guarantees that model equations are complete and
consistent, ultimately clarifying thinking, reducing debugging and
improving scientific communication.</p>

<p>For simple, equation-based models, a fully constrained model will have
as many variables as equations.  The current JSim compiler is not smart
enough to detect consistent systems with more equations that variables, as
might occur in the above model with the added relation "b=4".  In this
case, the compile would abort with a "model overconstrained" error
message.  Modelers can avoid this situation by matching the number of
equations with the number of variables to be solved.</strong>

<p class="crush">Some exceptions to the #variables = #constraints include 
the following (follow links for details):</p>
<ol class="crush">
<li>ODE variables require 2 equations - an initial condition and a state 
equation;</li>
<li>1D PDE variables <a href="MML_PDE.html">(more info)</a>require 4 
equations - an initial condition, two
boundary conditions and a state equation;</li>
<li>Event variables <a href="MML_Events.html">(more info)</a>require an 
initial condition and one or more
event statements;</li>
<li>MML procedures <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">(more info)</a> may 
constrain multiple variables with a single statment.</li>
</ol>

<p> By framing models in terms of constraints,  MML can easily
intermix mathematics (explicit & implicit equations, ODEs, PDEs),
discrete events and procedural code (e.g. Java, C, Fortran).  This
allows modelers to naturally mix computational methods as required
by the science,  rather than by shoehorning all model calculations
into a single computational framework.</p>

<h2> <a name="topics"> Further Topics </a> </h2>

<p> Most MML modeler writers will need to be familiar with the previous
topics.  Other features of MML are usually best learned as need arises,
to wit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicit equations<a href="MML_Implicit.html">(more info)</a>
- JSim supports both linear and non-linear implicit (sometimes
called simultaneous) equations.</li>
<li>Partial differential equations (PDEs) <a 
href="MML_PDE.html">(more info)</a> - JSim currently supports a 
variety of 1-dimensional PDEs.  Entended 1D support and some 2D 
support is under development.</li>
<li>Integrals and Summations <a href="MML_Integrals.html">(more info)</a> 
- MML
constructs for integration and summation.</li>
<li>Events <a href="MML_Events.html">(more info)</a> - MML 
constructs appropriate for discrete state changes, such as
gate openings and closings.  Event also support some recursive
function definitions.</li>
<li>Functions and procedures <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">(more info)</a> 
are mechanisms for embedding code from procedural languages such as 
Java, C and Fortran as constraints within MML models.
</li>
<li>Templates <a href="MML_Templates.html">(more info)</a> are MML's
mechanism for structuring model code and writing reusable model 
components.</li>
