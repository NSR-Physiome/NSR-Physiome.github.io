<h2><a name="first">First example</a></h2>

<p>MML uses the colon (:) to represent differentiation (for example u:t
represents du/dt).  This construct is used in formulating ODEs in MML.
Consider the following model of radioactive decay:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode1.proj"); ?>

<p>JSim requires an ODE variable (here "u") be given an "initial condition
(IC)" and a "state equation".  The IC constrains the initial value by
applying the "when" clause.  In the example, the simplest possible
constraint is used, that is, setting the numeric value.  In more
complicated systems, ICs may be calculated from other model
variables.  The state equation constrains the variable's first derivative
(here "u:t") for all time. (For simplicity, the word "time" is used in
this document to refer to an ODE variable's domain, however ODE variable
domains be assigned any unit appropriate to the model.)</p>

<p>If you run the above model in the JSim GUI, you will discover that
JSim creates a new IC variable u__init with default value 1 (matching the
MML equation).  This allows you to change the IC in the GUI without
recompiling the model.  If the IC for an ODE variable 
is calculated from other variables, the initial value will not be directly
changable within the GUI. </p>

<p>Note that IC's when clause must be formulated as "t=t.min".  You may
not use "t=0" or any other specific numeric value in an IC.</p>

<h2><a name="system">Systems of ODEs</a></h2>

<p>Consider the following model of diffusion between 3 compartments:</p>

<img src="../pics/ode_comp3.gif" />

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode_comp3.proj"); ?>

<p>Note that each of the three ODE variables (C1, C2, C3) has
both an initial condition (specified via the "when" clause) and a 
state equation.  The number of such equation in a JSim model is
limited only by computer memory,  not by JSim itself.</p>

<h2><a name="order">Second order equations</a></h2>

<p>2nd (and higher) order ODEs may be solved in JSim.  A Nth order ODE 
require N initial conditions (for u, u:t, ...).  The following example 
that generates a sinusoid via a 2nd order ODE:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode_order2.proj"); ?>

<h2><a name="implicit">Using implicit equations with ODEs</a></h2>

<p>You may use linear or non-linear implicit equations to specify
ODE ICs or state equations.  Consider the following example using
linear implicit equations to specify both ICs and state equations:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode_implicit.proj"); ?>

<p>Here JSim will solve u and v at t=t.min via the two implicit equations
in the when clause, and solve u:t and v:t via the last two equations.
There are a number of tricky issues regarding implicit equations in MML.
Model writers are <strong>strongly advised</strong> to read <a
href="MML_Implicit.html">Implicit Equations in MML</a> completely
before using this construct in their own models.</p>

<h2><a name="parallel">Parameterized parallel systems</a></h2>

<p>In some cases, you may wish to create a set of ODE variables that share
a common form.  The following code models flow through N parallel
compartments:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode_parallel.proj"); ?>

<p>Here a realDomain "n" is introduced to parameterize the N parallel
variables.  N is initially set to 5, but may be easily changed in the JSim
GUI.  The ODE variable C now takes both time and "n" as domains, and the
IC and state equations apply to each value of "n".  This approach make for
more concise and efficient code when a set of variables share a common
equation form, differing only in parameter values.  In this case,
compartment volume (V) varies over "n".</p>

<p>Special notes:</p>

<ul>

<li>The combined output concentration is calculated via the MML sum()
operator.  See <a href="MML_Integrals.html">Using Integrals and Summations
in MML</a> for details on summations.</li>

<li>The "private" statement ensures that N is the only variable affecting
the values of "n".  See <a href="MML_Topics.html#public">Public, Private
and Extern variables</a> for more information.</li>

<li>JSim internals issues currently prevent the value of N being set to 1.
This limitation will be addressed in future JSim releases.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="series">Parameterized serial system</a></h2>

<p>The following code models flow through a series of N compartments:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_ODE/ode_serial.proj"); ?>

<p>Most of the code is similar to the parallel example.  The state 
equation uses MML's "if/else" construct to compare a
compartment's concentration to its predecessor's.  The 1st compartment
is compared to the input (Cin).</p>

<p> The final "when" statement calculates Cout from the value of C at
maximum n.  This "when" construct is preferred to following which,
although possible, is not recommended due to technical reason:</p>

<pre>
Cout=C(t,N);
</pre>

<h2><a name="events">Using events with ODEs</a></h2>

<p>An MML ODE variable is inherently continuous, since it is calculated
from the integral of a real-valued function.  Certain physiological
systems, such as gate openings and closings, are inherently discontinuous.  
Events are MML's construct for such discrete changes.  See <a
href="MML_Events.html">Using Events in MML</a> for complete details.</p>
