<h2>  <a name="first">First Examples</a></h2>

<p>JSim can solve a large class of 1st degree 1-dimensional partial
differential equations (PDEs). The five examples illustrated here are 
the type of advection and diffusion equations  used to model
concentrations of materials in capillaries.</p>

<h3><a name="adv">Example 1: The Advection Equation</a></h3>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_PDE/Advection.proj"); ?>

<p>This is a pure advection (aka wave) equation in a tube. What comes in 
at the left hand boundary exits at the right hand boundary.</p>

<p>There are two independent variables, t in seconds, where t stands
for time, and x in centimeters, where x is a spatial variable.
The tube is parameterized by length L, volume V, and flow F.
The velocity in the tube, U, is given by U=F*L/V. The
transit time, Tmean (time for the input concentration to appear at the
outflow) is given by Tmean = V/F.</p>

<p>The left hand <a href="#bc">Dirichlet boundary condition</a> 
is 
given as -U*C = -U*Cin.</p>

<p>The right hand <a href="#bc">Neumann boundary condition</a>, 
C:x=0, is, strictly speaking, extraneous, insofaras there is only one 
derivative in the x space. However, JSim requires two boundary 
conditions for PDE's.</p>

<p>The result is the advection of the wave form (Lagged-normal curve 
representing a bolus injection) in the downstream direction.
See Figures 1 and 2 in the JSim applet.</p>

<h3><a name="diff">Example 2: The Diffusion Equation</a></h3>

<p>This models requires either the MacCormack or the Toms731
solver because it lacks flow. </p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_PDE/Diffusion.proj"); ?>

<p>A simple mass balance check is performed by integrating C with 
respect at x at model end time, t.max.</p>

<p>The left and right <a href="#bc">Neumann boundary conditions</a> can 
be written as either <pre>D*C:x = 0;</pre> or <pre>C:x=0;</pre></p>

<p>The result is an uncentered spike in the initial condition gradually
becomes rounded, flattens out. An integral of C(x,t.max) with respect
to x, shows that the amount of material is conserved.</p>

<h3><a name="advdiff">Example 3: The Combined Advection/Diffusion 
Equation</a></h3>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_PDE/AdvectionDiffusion.proj"); ?>

<p>The left hand <a href="#bc">total flux boundary condition</a> is 
written as -U*C + D*C:x = -U*Cin. The right hand boundary <a 
href="#bc">Neumann boundary condition</a> is written as either D*C:x = 0 
or C:x = 0. </p>

<p>Figure 1 in the JSim applet shows the outflowing concentration has a 
reduced peak height and is more spread out relative to the inflowing 
concentration. Figure 2, a contour plot of the concentration in time 
(vertical axis) and and space (horizontal axis) shows the concentration 
peak decaying and spreading out with time.</p>

<h3><a name="mult">Example 4: A Multiple Variable Problem</a></h3>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_PDE/CounterCurrent.proj"); ?>

<p>As with ODEs, PDE variables may interact with other PDE and ODE 
variables. This is an example of counter-current flow and exchange. Two 
tubes (capillaries) flowing in opposite direction exchange material with 
each other. The tube with flow from left to right (lr) is similar to the 
combined advection diffusion equation with exchange with the tube with 
flow from right to left (rl).</p>

<p>This model illustrates both left (lr) and right (rl) <a 
href="#bc">total flux boundary conditions</a> and right (lr) and left 
(rl) <a href="#bc">Neumann boundary conditions</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="note">Example 5: A Cautionary Note About Mixing PDEs with ODEs</a></h3> 

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_PDE/BTEX20NoDisf.proj"); ?>

<p>Mixing PDEs and ODEs can result in computational errors. This is an
example of a two region model (BTEX20) which compares having the 
diffusion coefficient in the non-flowing region, Disf, set to zero with having
no diffusion coefficient in the equation for the non-flowing region.
The results are different, and omitting the diffusion coefficient in the
PDE for the non-flowing region leads to erroneous results. In models
where the non-flowing regions may represent transporters bound to membranes
and no diffusion is possible, it is still necessary to include a diffusion
term with the diffusion coefficient set to zero. It is permissible to have
PDE and ODE models in series, but not in parallel.</p>
 
<h2><a name="bc">Types of Boundary Conditions for advection diffusion 
problems</a></h2>

<p>There are primarily three types of boundary conditions that JSim
can use for advection-diffusion problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a name="dirichlet">Dirichlet:</a> C (at either x.min or x.max) = 
g(t).</li>

<li><a name="neumann">Neumann:</a> C:x (at either x.min or x.max) = 0, 
primarily for the downstream boundary and required for LSFEA solver. C:x 
(at either x.min or x.max) = h(t), used with MacCormack and Toms731 
solver.</li>

<li><a name="flux">Total Flux:</a> -U*C + D*C:x = -U*Cin (at either 
x.min or x.max), primarily for the upstream boundary.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Initial and Boundary Consistency in PDEs</h2>

<p>A PDE variable's initial and boundary condition on the inflow
side of the problem must be consistent. Consider the following
initial and boundary condition:</p>

<pre>
when(t=t.min) {C(x,t)=f(x);} //implies C(x.min,t.min)=f(x.min)
when(x=x.min) {C(x,t)=g(t);} //implies C(x.min,t.min)=g(t.min)
</pre>

<p>Unless f(x.min)=g(t.min), the specification is inconsistent. This
problem is fixed by either rewriting the initial condition as</p>


<pre>
when(t=t.min) {C(x,t)=if(x=x.min) g(t) else f(x); } 
// implies C(x.min,t.min) = g(t.min) not f(x.min),
</pre>

<p>or rewriting the boundary condition as</p>

<pre>
when(x=x.min) {C(x,t) = if(t=t.min) f(x) else g(t); }
// implies C(x.min,t.min) = f(x.min) not g(t.min).
</pre>

<p>Jsim rejects model runs with inconsistent boundary 
specifications.</p>

<h2><a name="avail">Available PDE Solvers</a></h2>

<p>JSim currently has three PDE solvers available:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="#lsfea">LSFEA</a> - Lagrangian Sliding Fluid Element Algorithm;</li>
<li> <a href="#maccormack">MacCormack</a> - 2nd order finite difference 
method 
with
optional flux-corrected transport for hyperbolic and parabolic equations;</li>
<li> <a href="#toms731">Toms731</a> - adaptive moving grid method for univariate
partial differential equations;</li>
</ol>

<p>LSFEA is the fastest solver, but is applicable to the narrowest range 
of equations.  For example, LSFEA does not handle pure diffusion 
equations.  Toms731 somewhat slower than LSFEA, but handles some 
equations (e.g. pure diffusion) LSFEA can't.  Toms731 is slower still, 
but handles some non-linear problems the other solvers can't.  An exact 
mathematical description of what equations each solver can handle 
follows in the remaining sections of this document. However, the user 
need not be overly concerned with the exact solver requirements, since 
the JSim compiler determines which solvers are appropriate for a set of 
PDEs, the fastest of which becomes the default solver. For more advanced 
users, the JSim user environment allows the user to select amoung 
available solvers.</p>

<p>In order to describe JSim's PDE solvers further, we must first 
describe a bit about how JSim processes PDEs.  When the JSim compiler 
encounters a PDE, it attempts to factor the equation and boundary 
conditions into the <em>standard equation form</em> for each PDE solver, 
using simple algebraic manipulations.  The standard form varies betweens 
solvers. If the factorization for a given solver succeeds, JSim will 
allow that solver to be used at run-time.  Bear in mind that successful 
numeric calculation depends both equations stability and the solver 
used. If the factorization fails for all available solvers, then the 
compiler will abort with an appropriate error message.</p>

<p>We define a PDE equation block as a set of PDEs whose state equation 
or boundary conditions share state variables.  PDE solvers operate on 
blocks of equations, rather than on individual equations, and some 
properties of the block are relevant to solver performance.  In the 
following example, u and v share an equation block because their state 
equations depend upon each other:

<pre>
      u:t = u:x:x - u:x - u + v;
      v:t = v - u;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>  <a name="lsfea">The LSFEA Solver</a></h2>

<p>The LSFEA solver supports PDE state and boundary equations that
can be factored as follows:</p>

<pre>
      u:t = D*u:x:x - B*u:x + S;
      when (x=x.min) f1*u + f2*u:x = f3;
      when (x=x.max) g1*u + g2*u:x = g3;
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
<li>D*u:x:x is called the diffusion term, D the diffusion 
coefficient;</li>
<li>B*u:x is called the advection term;</li>
<li>S is called the source or sink term;</li>

<li>Algebraic expressions B, D, S, f1, f2, f3, g1, g2 and g3 may  
not contain any derivative variables (e.g. u:x);</li>
<li>B and D must be spatially invariant (no x dependency);</li>
<li>D must be non-negative;</li>
<li>f1, f2, f3, g1, g2 and g3 may not contain u;</li>
<li>If B=0 then f1, f3, g1 and g3 must be zero;</li>
<li>If B>0, then f1 must be non-zero;</li>
<li>If B<0, then g1 must be non-zero;</li>
<li>At least one of f1 and g1 must be zero;</li>
<li>At least one of f2 and g2 must be non-zero;</li>
<li>at least one PDE in the equation block must have a non-zero B
value;</li>
</ul>

<h2>  <a name="maccormack">The MacCormack Solver</a></h2>

<p>The MacCormack solver requires the PDE state and boundary equations 
that can be factored as follows:</p>

<pre>
      u:t = D*u:x:x - B*u:x + S;
      when (x=x.min) f1*u + f2*u:x = f3;
      when (x=x.max) g1*u + g2*u:x = g3;
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<ul> 
<li>B, D, S, f1, f2, f3, g1, g2, g3 are defined as in LSFEA and 
may no contain any derivative variables;</li>
<li>D  must be non-negative.</li> 
<li>f1, f2, f3, g1, g2 and g3 may not contain u;</li>
</ul>

<h2>  <a name="toms731">The Toms731 Solver</a></h2>

<p>The Toms731 solver requires the PDE state and boundary equations 
that can be factored as follows:</p>

<pre>
      u:t = D*u:x:x + P;
      when (x=x.min) f1*u + f2*u:x = f3;
      when (x=x.max) g1*u + g2*u:x = g3;
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
<li>D and P are expressions of u, u:x or other non-derivative model
variables (note that this is a more general form than the one used
for LSFEA and MacCormack);</li>
<li>f1, f2, f3, g1, g2 and g3 may not contain u;</li>
<li>D is symbolically differentiable (i.e. it may not contain extern 
variables or JSim <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">F&P calls</a>);</li>
