<p>This page defines basic JSim terminology, with pointers to additional
information.</p>

<dl class="jsimglos">

  <dt>API</dt>
  <dd>For "Application Programmer Interface", is a specification for
how to write computer code to work properly with a given software system.
JSim provides several API's for interaction.
<a href="Devel_API.html":>More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>BCL</dt>
  <dd>For "Biological Component Library", a set of JSim templates 
designed for component-wise building of biological models.  The only
BCL currently distributed with JSim is MFAX.
<a href="MML_MFAX_Intro.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>data set</dt>
  <dd>A JSim accessible collection of numeric data.  Data sets may
be imported/exported to and from JSim via a variety of supported data
file formats.
<a href="User_DataSets.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>event</dt>
  <dd>An MML construct for describing discrete state changes, such
as gate openings and closings. 
<a href="MML_Events.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>functions & procedures</dt>
  <dd>MML constructs for the embedding of procedural code (e.g. Java,
C, Fortran) in MML models. Also called F&P. <a 
href="MML_Func_Intro.html">More info
</a>.</dd>

  <dt>MFAX</dt>
  <dd>For "Metabolite Flow And eXchange", this BCL allow component-wise
modeling of compartments, chemical reactions, flow and membrane transport.
<a href="MML_MFAX_Intro.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>MML</dt>
  <dd>For "Mathematical Modeling Language", MML is the language JSim 
uses to specify models.  
<a href="MML.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>jsbatch</dt>
  <dd>A command-line program, distributed with the JSim suite,
accessing the JSim computational engine in a batch-oriented 
environment. 
<a href="Devel_Batch.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>jsfim</dt>
  <dd>A command-line program, distributed with the JSim suite, for
generating functional images. 
<a href="User_Fim.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>JSim</dt>
  <dd>Spelled "JSim" refers to the entire JSim software project,  
including its distributed programs (jsim, jsbatch, jsfim, jsserver),
and file format (MML, RTML, project, various data files).</dd>

  <dt>jsim</dt>
  <dd>Spelled "jsim" refers to the JSim graphical user interface(GUI)
which is the most commonly used program in the JSim suite.  Also known
as the JSim GUI.
<a href="User_Ref.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>jsserver</dt>
  <dd>A program, distributed with the JSim suite, that creates 
a network-accessible JSim computational engine for use by JSim
user programs (jsim, jsbatch, jsfim) or WWW applets.
<a href="Admin_Server.html"> More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>NSR</dt>
  <dd>For "National Simulation Resource", the National Simulation Resource
for Transport, Metabolism and Reaction creates, collects and disseminates
material of interest to biological modelers, including JSim. 
<a href="http://nsr.bioeng.washington.edu"> More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>plug-in</dt>
  <dd>A code module (JAR format) that is loaded into JSim at run-time
to enhance functionality.
<a href="Devel_Plugin.html"> More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>project file</dt>
  <dd>An XML-based file encapsulating a set of JSim models, datasets,
parameters sets, plot pages and notes.  Project files are the normal
means for sharing a fully configured JSim analysis.
<a href="User_Projects.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>RTML</dt>
  <dd>For "Run-Time Markup Language", RTML is an XML specification
for graphic model markup for use within the JSim GUI, allowing model
authors to customize the run-time appearance of their models.
<a href="MML_RTML_Intro.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>template</dt>
  <dd>An MML construct for creating structured code and reusable model 
components. <a href="MML_Templates.html">More info</a>.</dd>

  <dt>XSIM</dt>
  <dd>An X-windows based simulation system, developed and distributed by
NSR, that was JSim's predecessor. The XSIM application is no longer
supported, however many popular XSIM models have been adapted to run under
JSim. <a href="MML_XSim_Intro.html">More info</a>.</dd>
