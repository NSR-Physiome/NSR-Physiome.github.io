<h1>JSim and Antimony</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Antimony is a simple text language for specifying SBML style models.
This document describes how to write Antimony models within 
JSim, and how to import and export Antimony files to and from JSim.  
This is not a tutorial of the Antimony language.  For that,  see the <a 
href="http://antimony.sourceforge.net/">Antimony Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>Antimony support within JSim is available for JSim version 2.03 and 
above.</p>

<h2>  <a name="what">What is Antimony?</a></h2>

<p>Antimony is a human-readable computer language for describing SBML 
style models developed by Lucian Smith.  A complete description of the 
Antimony language, along with various Antimony software, is available on 
the <a href="http://antimony.sourceforge.net/">Antimony Home Page</a>.  
Antimony is designed to be "equivalent" to SBML in the sense that an 
Antimony and its SBML translation describe exactly the same model.
From JSim's perspective, Antimony provides a simple and concise language 
for editing chemical network models.  Since it, unlike SBML, it can 
be edited by hand,  it makes for a quick path to SBML-style chemical
network modeling within JSim.</p>

<h2>  <a name="mml">Writing Antimony models in JSim</a></h2>

<p>Antimony code can be written within an MML model (or .mod file) by 
surrounding the Antimony text with the keyword "antimony" and double 
curly braces.  Consider the following Antimony model of enzyme-substrate 
binding:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Antimony/es.txt"); ?>

<p>Antimony code can be embedded in a JSim model by prepending the 
keyword "antimony" and surrounding the code in double-curly braces:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Antimony/es.mod"); ?>

<p>When the model above is compiled, JSim translates the embedded 
Antimony code to flattened MML and then compiles that.  If you wish to 
see the flattened MML version of an Antimony model, you may do so in the 
JSim GUI by selecting "View flat MML text" from the View menu in the 
model's Debug tab. Alternatively, jsbatch (command line) users should 
use the "-oflat" switch:</p>

<pre>
jsbatch -f sb.mod -oflat &gt; sbflat.mod  // assumes sb.mod contains embedded Antimony
</pre>

<p>Note that, at present, a JSim model may be either standard MML or 
embedded Antimony.  The two types of models cannot be mixed.  However, 
mixing of models is planned for the <a href="#future">future</a>.</p>


<h2>  <a name="import">Importing Antimony Files into JSim</a></h2>

<p>To import an Antimony model into JSim, select "Import model file" 
from the "Add" menu under the JSim GUI's "Project" tab.  Antimony files 
have extension .txt.  (Note that .txt is used by many other files 
besides Antimony, so be sure to pick a real Antimony file.)  
Alternatively, you can load a Antimony file via the -f switch on the 
command line of either jsim or jsbatch.</p>

<p>When an Antimony file is read into JSim the keyword "antimony" and 
surrounded double curly braces are added automatically.</p>

<p>Batch translation of Antimony files to embedded MML may be 
accomplished as follows:</p>
 
<pre>
jsbatch -f somemodel.txt -omml &gt; somemodel.mod
</pre>

<p>Windows users: If you are receiving errors from JSim concerning libSBML please see <a href="../download/win32.html#WindowsSBML">Installing JSim under MS Windows:  SBML, Antimony, and Matlab.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="export">Exporting Antimony Files from JSim</a></h2>

<p>Any MML model may be exported to Antimony, not merely models 
containing embedded Antimony.  However, since Antimony is equivalent to 
SBML, the <a href="MML_SBML.html#export_tech">same export 
limitations</a> apply.</p>

<p>To export Antimony from the JSim GUI, compile it, click on the model 
"Debug" tab and select "View Antimony" from the "View" menu.  Translated 
Antimony will appear in the text area.  If any warnings are generated in 
the translation, a button "Show N translator warnings" will appear. 
Clicking this button will display the warnings in the JSim message
area (right half of GUI).</p>

<p>To export Antimony from the command line,  use the "-oantimony" 
switch
in <a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a>:</p>

<pre>
jsbatch -f somemodel.mod -oantimony &gt; somemodel.xml
   or
jsbatch -f somemodel.proj -oantimony &gt; somemodel.xml
</pre>

<p>Windows users: If you are receiving errors from JSim concerning libSBML and antimony translation, please see <a href="../download/win32.html#WindowsSBML">Installing JSim under MS Windows:  SBML, Antimony, and Matlab.</a>
</p>


<h2>  <a name="future">Future plans</a></h2>

<p>The following improvements are planned for the future:</p>

<ol>

<li>Antimony support for physical units (currently missing).</li>

<li>The ability to mix standard MML and embedded Antimony within the 
same model.</li>

</ol>
