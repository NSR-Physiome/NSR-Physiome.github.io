<h2><a name="over">Overview</a></h2>

<p>Nested plots are a feature of JSim 2.07 and above for enhanced 
visualization of multi-dimensional data.  Nested plots are based on Bosan 
and Harris's "Worlds Within Worlds" graphics (<a href="#note1">Note 
1</a>).  A more limited version of nested plots was available in <a 
href="/software/xsim">XSIM</a> under the name "Behavioural Analysis".</p>

<p>A nested plot is, most typically, a rectangular array of plots where 
each row and column represent a specific paramter value.  In the example 
below, Each row represents a value of the parameter "phase" and each 
column represents a value of the parameter "amp".  Within each plot the X 
axis represents the parameter "t", while the Y axis represents the 
dependent variable u(t,amp,phase).  Thus this example allows 
visualization of 3 independent variables: t, amp and phase.</p>

<h2><a name="terms">Terminology</a></h2>

<p>The user configues a nested plot by selecting the data to be plotted 
and then mapping <b>data domains</b> onto <b>rendering axes</b>.  Data to 
be plotted may model variables or algebraic expressions or data set 
curves.  The data domains of a model variable or expression its 
realDomains.  Model data becomes available for plotting once the model
has been run.  If model loops are run,  "inner loop" and/or "outer loop"
are added to the data domains, depending upon the loop configuration. 
When the data to be plotted is drawn from a data set curve,  the data 
domains are the grids of the curve.</p>

<p>Rendering axes are of four types: inner spatial axes,  outer spatial 
axes,  attribute axes and slider axes.</p>

<p><b>Inner spatial axes (X1, Y1, Z)</b> are the X and Y axes of a single 
plot.  When the plot style is "XY plot", X1 independent and  
Y1 is dependent.  When the plot style is "contour", the X1 and Y1 are 
independent and Z is dependent.</p>

<p><b>Outer spatial axes (X2, Y2)</b> refer the the column and rows
of individual plots respectively.</p>

<p><b>Attribute axes (LINE, COLOR, SIZE, SHAPE, THICKNESS)</b> refer
use of curve rendering characteristics to show variation.  The example
below renders the same data as the first example,  but with the
data domain "phase" assigned to the COLOR axis instead of the Y2 axis.
Each color of curve represents a different value of phase.</p>

<img src="/jsim/pics/Nested2.png" />

<p><b>Slider axes</b> are user-controllable sliders that select a 
particular value from a data domain for rendering.  When the slider 
is moved (via mouse or keystroke) the nested plot is redrawn using
the new data domain value.  This enables data visualization via 
animation.</p>

<h2><a name="xy">Basic XY Plot Configuration</a></h2>

<p>I'll use the model below to show how to configure nested plots. The 
model contains 3 realDomain: t, decay and phase.  These realDomains,  plus
the parameter "offset" control output curves u and v, which are 
sine and cosine curves with exponential decay.</p>

<?php jsDownApp("examples/User/nestedStart.proj"); ?>

<p>Start the applet above or download the project and run it within
JSim (version 2.07 or above) on your own system.  Create a new nested
plot by selecting "New nested plot" from the "Project" tab "Add" menu.
On the line labeled "Data",  click on the down arrow beside the white
text field and select "u".  Alternatively,  just type "u" into the
text field.  The text field should blacked,  indicating that "u" is a
valid variable within model "trigd".</p>

<p>Note that the graphics are shows "No data available".  This is
because the model has not yet been run.  Run the model and the data 
display will update.  You may be initially disappointed with the
resulting graph,  which shows a constant value u=0.  This is because
we have not yet assigned u's data domains to any rendering axes.  
When a data domain is so unassigned,  a slider axis is created for
the domain.  You should see three such sliders, for the realDomains 
t, decay and phase.</p>

<p>We'll start assign domains to axes with the X1 axis.  Note the 
"X1 Axis" line currently shows "no variation".  Click on "no
variation" to show possible domains to assign to the X1 axis,  and 
select "t".  Domain t is now assigned to the X1 axis,  and the
graphics should show a sinusoid.  The slider for domain "t" has now
disappeared,  although the sliders for domains "decay" and "phase"
remain.  Try moving the "decay" and "phase" sliders and note the 
resulting change in the graph.</p>

<p>Now we'll configure the X2 and Y2 axes to show the variation of
"decay" and "phase" within a single image.  From the "Nesting" menu,
select "enable X-axis nesting".  A new line "X2 Axis" will appear in
the configurator with the domain selector set to "no variation".  At
the same time,  the graphics will now show a horizonal array of 5 
identical graphs.  You may change the number of graphs with the "#X
subaxes" control at the top the of page,  but lets leave it at 5 for
now.  Click on the X2 Axis domain selector and change it from "no
variation" to "decay".  The graphics will update to show 5 different
values of "decay".  Note also that the "decay" slider has disappeared.
</p>

<p>Configuring the Y2 axis, is similar to configuring X2.  From the 
"Nesting" menu, select "enable Y-axis nesting".  A new line "Y2 Axis"
will appear in the configurator with the domain selector set to "no
variation".  At the same time, the graphics area now shows a 5x5 array
of plots.  The X2 axis shows variation in domain "decay",  but the Y2
axis shows no variation.  Click on the Y2 Axis domain selector and 
change it from "no variation" to "phase".  The graphics will update
showing "decay" variation horizontally and "phase" variation
vertically.  At the same time,  the "phase" slider will disappear.
Note that if you make the mistake of assigning the same data domain
to more than one axis,  an error message is generated in the graphic
display that will remain until the duplication is removed.  Your
graphic display should now look similar to the following:</p>

<img src="/jsim/pics/Nested3.png" />

<p>The "Loops" tab of the example project is configured so that the "inner
loop" varies model parameter "offset".  Run model loops now. The nested
plot graphic display looks very similar to before (although it has a
different scale)  and a new slider appears  with the name "trigd: inner
loop".  Moving this slider will show how the parameter "offset" affects
model output.  From the "Nesting" menu select "Enable color variation". A
new line labeled "COLOR" will appear in the configurator with its domain
selector set to "no variation".  Change the domain selector to "inner
loop".  The resulting display will use color variation to show how model
output varies with parameter "offset".  Some sets of colors may be more
pleasing to the eye than others.  You may vary which colors are used by
altering the square color control located under the "Data" line text box.
The final result should look similar the following:</p>

<img src="/jsim/pics/Nested4.png" /> 

<p>Instead of using "COLOR" variation,  you may wish to experiment with
other attribute variation.  To do this,  disable color variation in the
"Nesting" menu,  enable another type of variation,  and proceed
similarly.</p>

<h2><a name="contour">Contour Plot Configuration</a></h2>

<p>Configuring nested plots using contours is largely similar to
that using XY plots.  We'll use the same project as a starting point:</p>

<?php jsDownApp("examples/User/nestedStart.proj"); ?>

<p>Restart the above applet, or run JSim using the downloaded project file.
Run model <b>loops</b>,  then create a new nested plot tab as before.
Click on "XY plot" in the upper left of the nested plot configurator and
change it to "contour".  Notice there are now 3 axes: X1 and Y1 for data
domains and Z for the dependent variable.  Enter "u" in the "Data" line
selection box.  It should blacken,  and an empty contour plot will appear
in the graphics area.  Set the "X1 Axis" variation control to "t" and 
the "Y1 Axis" variation control to "inner loop".  Wavy line contours
should appear in the graphics area.  Change the colormap control on line 3
of the configuration area from "no colormap" to "area fill map".  The
contours should now be filled will colors from the "heat" color scale, 
resembling the following:</p>

<img src="/jsim/pics/Nested5.png" /> 

<p>Now, as in the XY plot example, enable X and Y nesting from the
"Nesting" menu and set the X2 axis variation to "decay" and the Y2
axis variation to "phase".  Voila!</p>

<h2><a name="nice">Some Niceties</a></h2>

<p>A default "Title" and "Footer" appear is your plot for labeling
purposes.  Click on either one to edit the text.  If you'd rather use 
that space for graphics,  toggle the "Show title" and/or "Show footer"
items from the "View" menu.  The "View" menu also allows you to hide
the entire configurator to maximize the graphics area once configuration
is complete.</p>

<p>When either X or Y nesting is activated,  clicking on a single plot
zooms the display into that single plot for closer examination.  Clicking
on the zoomed plot,  reverts JSim to the normal nested display.</p>

<p>A text representation of the data in a nested plot is available for
display and export via the "Text" tab and the bottom of a nested plot.</p>

<p>All axes offer autoscale or manual scale options.  When autoscale is
off,  manual scale bounds become active and are editable.</p>

<p>X1 and Y1 axes offer optional log scaling.</p>

<p>Outer spatial axis (X2, Y2) and attribute axes (e.g. COLOR) offer a
choice of sampling methods: "linear samples", "log samples" and "list
samples".  The first two methods pick a number of samples between the
specified data min and max.  "list samples" allows the user to enter a
comma separated list of the sample values desired.  The list must be in
strictly ascending numerical order.</p>

<p>The variable scaling control on top line of the configurator has three
possible values.  It applies to the scaling of the dependent variable and 
inner spatial axis ranges when autoscale is on.  The default "global
scaling" is usually appropriate, however the other options are sometimes
useful:</p>

<ul>

<li>global scaling: autoscale to the range of the entire data set under
study, including all possible slider values.  This will not rescale
when sliders are moved,  allowing animation to be meaningful.</li>

<li>page scaling: autoscale to the range of all visible data curves.  This
will rescale when sliders are moved to present the most robust view
for the present slider values.</li>

<li>local scaling: autoscale each individual plot separately.  This can 
be useful when different plots have vastly different scales.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="limit">Bugs and Limitations</a></h2>

<p>The following bugs and limitations are recognized by the developers
and will be addressed as time allows:</p>

<ul>

<li>The graphics are a little flakey.  Sometimes clicking on another
right-side tab and then returning to the nested plot tab is necessary
to clean up the display.</li>

<li>Axis tic marks and numeric labels are substandard.</li>

<li>Graphics are displayed after each model run terminates.  The is
currently no "update during run" option like there is in standard plot
pages.</li>

<li>Plotting one variable on the X axis against another on the Y axis,
as in a phase plot,  is not yet supported.</li>

<li>Labeling of multiple plot curves is absent in nested displays and
suboptimal in zoomed displays.</li>

<li>Encapsulated Postscript export is not yet available as it is in
standard plot pages.</li>

</ul>
