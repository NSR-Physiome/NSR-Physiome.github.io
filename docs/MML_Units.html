<h1>Using Physical Units in MML</h1>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p> This document describes using physical units in MML models.  This
feature is useful both for documenting models and for insuring they are
dimensionally correct.</p>

<h2>  <a name="phys">Physical Units</a></h2>

<p>    MML variables may be assigned physical units (e.g. meter/sec) for either
documentation or calculation purposes.  Using MML units requires three
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> defining the system of units to be used;</li>
<li> deciding on a unit conversion policy;</li>
<li> declaring variables with units clauses.</li>
</ol>

<p> (1) JSim has no predefined units policy.  The unit system is 
flexible enough to allow intermixing of e.g. CGS, MKS, English and user 
custom units as needed.  The radian unit is predefined, but all other 
units must be declared in the model file.  Most users will wish to 
import the NSR unit library (nsrunit.mod) that is distributed with JSim. 
A subsequent section describes how model files may define additional 
units.</p>

<p> You may examine the NSR unit library definition file (nsrunit.mod) 
to see what units are predefined in that file.  This file may be found 
in common/nsrunit.mod within the JSim distribution directory.  A single 
unit may have multiple names.  For example, meters may be written either 
as "meter" or as "m", but not as "meters".  Also, unit name space is 
separate from variable name space, so there is no problem defining a 
variable with name "m", even though this is also the name of a physical 
unit.</p>

<p> (2) To use JSim units, a model file must declare either "unit 
conversion on" or "unit conversion off".  With unit conversion on, 
variable constraints are checked for unit consistency and conversion 
factors are calculated internally.  Any constraint that is not 
consistent will generate an error. With unit conversion off, a variable 
may still be declared with units, but the declaration is merely 
documentation and has no effect on the run-time calculations.</p>

<p> (3) Declaring variables with units simply requires a unit expression 
following the variable name.  The unit expression may combine any of the 
previously defined units using the operators * (multiply), / (divide), ^ 
(exponentiation), and 1/ (inverse).  Examples:</p>

<pre>
      realDomain t sec;         // time in seconds
      real area m^2;            // area in square meters
      real f(t) kg*m/sec^2;     // force in newtons
      real h(t) 1/sec;          // frequency in Hertz
</pre>

<h2>  <a name="example">Some examples with units</a></h2>

<p> A simple, complete example follows.  Note that the import and unit 
conversion directives come before the math block.:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Units/units1.proj"); ?>

<p> The run-time output of this model is as follows:</p>

<pre>
      dist1 = 3 m
      dist2 = 2 m
      dist3 = 500 cm    
</pre>

<p> To obtain the same results from a model with unit conversion off, 
the explicit conversion of meters to centimeters must be written into 
the MML:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Units/units2.proj"); ?>

<p> The run-time output of this model is as follows:</p>

<pre>
      dist1 = 3 m
      dist2 = 2 m
      dist3 = 500 cm
</pre>

<p> With unit conversion on, JSim rejects unit-inconsistent models. This 
can be a handy debugging tool when complicated equations are involved.  
The "c=a+b" constraint below will generate a unit inconsistency error 
since kilograms and seconds are incompatible.:</p>

<pre>
import nsrunit;
unit conversion on;
math example6c {
  real a kg, b sec, c sec;  
  a = 3;
  b = 2;
  c = a + b;
}
</pre>

<h2>  <a name="more">More About Units</a></h2>

<p> Combined variable declaration and constraints assign variable units 
as might be expected:</p>

<pre>
      real a = 4 kg/sec;   //  a will be in kg/sec
</pre>

<p> Some formulas require numeric constants with units to be 
dimensionally correct. Such expressions usually require enclosing 
parentheses:</p>

<pre>
      real dt = 10 sec;
      real dist km;
      dist = dt * (12 km/sec);  // distance = elapsed time * speed
</pre>

<p> With unit conversion on, variables declared without units will be 
assigned units that are compatible with its constraints:</p>

<pre>
      real a km;
      real b sec;
      real c = a/b;     // c will be in km/sec
</pre>

<p> The automatically assigned unit will almost always be dimensionally 
consistent, but it may not be the unit the MML author has in mind.  
Authors particular about the desired unit should assign it to the 
variable explicitly.  In (usually rare) cases no reasonable guess can be 
made for a variable's unit, so it will be set dimensionless.  If this 
assignment results in inconsistencies, the model writer should add an 
explicit unit declaration.</p>

<p> Dimensionless variables should so declared:</p>

<pre>
      real a km, b cm;
      real c dimensionless;
      b = c*a;
</pre>

<p> The predefined radian unit is equivalent to "dimensionless". Note 
that built-in trigonometric and logarithmic functions require arguments 
in radians, so appropriate conversion constants may be required.  For 
example:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Units/units4.proj"); ?>

      math sinewave {
          real t sec;   // time in seconds
          t.min=0; t.max=2*PI; t.ct=33;
          real u(t) = sin(t/(1 sec));  // dimensionless u has period 2*PI seconds
      }

<p>    The "import nsrunit", unit declaration and unit conversion statements
may appear in any order so long as any unit declaration(s) follow the
"import nsrunit" statement.</p>

<h2>  <a name="def">Defining Additional Units</a></h2>
<p>    You may define additional units for a model using the "unit" 
clause:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Units/units3.proj"); ?>

<p>    The "prefixable" declaration above, enables the standard SI prefixes
(milli, kilo, micro, etc.) for the unit "teaspoon".  "furlongs" is not
declared as prefixable in this example, so the declaration "megafurlong"
would result in an error. A unit defined as "fundamental" is a new unit that cannot be expressed as any other defined units. The variable "car" has units of mySpecialOne/furlong.</p>
