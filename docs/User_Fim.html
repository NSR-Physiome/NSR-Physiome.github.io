<h2> <a name="over">Overview</a></h2> 

<p> A JSim functional image is a data curve that maps a model parameter to
some visual space.  For example, a cardiac bullseye image represents the
left ventricle myocardium as a multicolored circular disk where color
values code model parameter values for corresponding segments of the
myocardium. jsfim thinks of a functional image as a collection of values
corresponding to image segments and provides the mechanism to calculate
these values using JSim models and store the results. It is up to external
programs (such as I4 or J4) to render the resulting data files using
appropriate geometries and color scales.</p>

<p> jsfim operates by optimizing a specified set of JSim model parameters
to match a data curve specific for each image segment.  A separate
functional image data curve is generated for each model parameter varied
during the optimizations. jsfim requires an input project file and one or
more input data files.  It is designed so that a properly configured
project file can be reused with many different data files without
modification.</p>

<p> The project file must contain a JSim model whose optimization tab is
mostly set up. The "Parameters to Vary" must be complete.  One output
bullseye will be generated for each of these parameters.  In the "Data to
Match" section, the 1st line must contain valid entries in the Par/Expr
Pwgt and Cwgt columns.  The DataSet and Curve columns are controlled by
jsfim, and need not be preconfigured.  jsfim does not manipulate "Data to
Match" lines beyond the 1st one.  If there is more than one model in the
project, you must tell jsfim which model to use via the -model switch.  
</p>

<p> The required data file must contain sample curves for each image
segment.  This file may also contain other curves, including input
function driving data.  By default, all curves in the data file are
treated as sample curves.  If the data file contains other curves
(such as input drivers),  you must use the -ref switch to specify
which curves should be used as segment samples. </p>

<p> Upon completing the optimzations for each image segment, a data file
containing functional image curves (one for each optimization parameter)
is written to the standard output (or to a file, if -o is specified). By
default, the output is written in <a
href="User_DataSets.html#column">columnar data format</a>, which is
appropriate for the J4 imaging system.  I4 users desiring <a
href="User_DataSets.html#i4bull">I4 bullseye</a> output should consult the
<a href="#example">example below</a>.</p>

<h2>  <a name="syntax">Command Syntax</a></h2>
<p>    The syntax of the jsfim command is as follows:</p>

<pre>
<?php readfile("jsfimUsage.txt"); ?>
</pre>

<h3>    Switch details</h3>

<h4><a name="model"> -model name</a></h4>
<p>Select the named model within the project file.  This switch is 
required only when the project file contains multiple models.</p>

<h4><a name="i"> -i v=expr</a></h4> <p> Assigns the value
of model parameter v to an algebraic expression.</p>

<h4><a name="fgen"> -fgen [file] v=curve</a></h4> 

<p> Assigns the values of model parameter v to an function generator
utilizing curve from the [file] (if present) or the primary data file
(if not).  The curve may be specified by either name or description. 
This flexibility is most important for TAC file curves whose
descriptions (e.g. "lacav") are usually easier to deal with than their
names (e.g. "R1i1"). The file name may not contain the equals sign
(=). If v is already assigned to a function generator, that function
generator is used.  If not, a new function generator is created.  This
switch may be used multiple times if more than one assignment is
desired.</p>

<h4><a name="o">      -o file</a></h4>

<p> Write functional image output to file.  By default, output is directed
to the standard output, usually the terminal.</p>

<h4><a name="ofit">      -ofit file</a></h4>

<p> Write optimization fit data to file.  By default, this data is not 
written anywhere.  Fit data is written in JSML format.</p>

<h4><a name="log">      -log file</a></h4>

<p> Save a optimization results report for each image segment in the 
specified file.</p>

<h4><a name="ofmt">      -ofmt dataformat</a></h4>

<p> Write functional image output in the specified format.  The default is
"column".  I4 users will usually prefer "i4bull". See <a
href="User_DataSets.html">here</a> for a complete list.</p>

<h4><a name="ofitfmt">      -ofitfmt dataformat</a></h4>

<p> Write model fit output in the specified format.  The default is "JSML". 
See <a href="User_DataSets.html">here</a> for a complete list. This switch is
available in JSim releases 2.14 and above.</p>

<h4><a name="oprec">      -oprec integer</a></h4>

<p> Write output data to the specified number of digits of precision.
The default is 8,  which is appropriate for single-precision numbers.</p>

<h4><a name="ref">      -ref prefix</a></h4>

<p> Treat only data curve names or descriptions beginning with the specified prefix
as segment sample curves.  This is useful when the data file contains 
other data curves.  By default,  all curves in the data file are 
treated as segment sample curves.</p>

<h4><a name="refx">      -refx name</a></h4>

<p>Exclude ref curves by name.  This is useful when the data file contains 
curves that should be excluded from modeling.  This switch is 
available in JSim release 2.13 and above.</p>

<h4><a name="oproj">      -oproj</a></h4>

<p> Write the current project file state and exit.  No optimizations are
performed, and no functional image data is written.  This project output
can then be run interactively using the JSim GUI to diagnose various
configuration and scientific problems.</p>

<h4><a name="noabort">      -noabort</a></h4>
<p> Do not abort entire run if optimizer fails for some segments.

Functional image values will be NaN's at values in segments where the optimizer
fails.  Without this switch,  the entire run aborts if the optimzer
fails on any segment.</p>

<h4><a name="conflim">      -conflim</a></h4>

<p> Calculate parameter confidence limits after each optimization.  This
require P*S additional model evaluations, where P is the number of
parameters to be optimized and S in the number of image segments.</p>

<h4><a name="silent">      -silent</a></h4>

<p> Repress the processing messages that are normally generated
as jsfim runs.</p>

<h4><a name="mp">      -mp N</a></h4>

<p> Use a maximum of N processors for parallizable run-time
calculations.  If N is greater that the number of system processors, the
lower number is used.  By default,  only one processor is used.</p>

<h4><a name="server">      -server name</a></h4>

<p> Connects to a remote computational server. By default, a local
server is used.  This switch available in JSim version 2.07 and above.</p>

<h3><a name="builddirsfx">-builddirsfx SUFFIX</a></h3> 
<p>Specify the temporary build directory as $HOME/.jsim/workSUFFIX.  The specified build directory must NOT EXIST, or else JSim will exit with 
an error. This switch is for expert
use only. It was added to prevent large numbers of simultaneous JSim jobs
getting confused about whose build directory is whose.  When using this switch,
the user is responsible that no two JSim jobs are using the same build directory at
the same time, lest unexpected (read bad) results occur.  This switch is available 
in JSim 2.09 and above.</p>

<h4><a name="usage">      -usage</a></h4>

<p>  Print jsfim syntax synopsis and exit. </p>

<h2>  <a name="example">Example Usage</a></h2>

<p> Suppose the following: You wish to generate functional images for
parameter P1 and P2 in model example.mod.  The model contains extern variable
Cin(t) that must be driven by samples from a left atrial ROI.  The model output
Cout will be match against sample curves for each image sector during 
optimization.</p>

<p> First, generate an appropriate jsfim project file as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="../download">JSim</a> on your system, if it's 
not already there.</p>
<li> Start jsim, load the model and compile it;</li>
<li> Select the model optimization tab.  Adjust overall optimizer 
parameters (e.g. algorithm, #calls, etc.) as appropriate.  Put P1 and P2 
in the "Parameters to Vary" section and set appropriate starting values
and bounds for each.  In the 1st line under "Data to Match",  set 
the Par/Expr column value to Cout and set the Pwgt and Cwgt columns
appropriately.</li>
<li> Save the project as fim.proj.</li>
</ol>

<p> Now use the <a href="#J4">J4</a> or <a href="#I4">I4</a> system instructions below
to generate jsfim input files, depending on which system you're using.</p>

<h3> <a name="J4">J4 Example Instructions</a> </h3>

<p> The J4 system is still under development.  As currently envisioned, it will generate
separate data files (columnar data format) for the input and segment sample curves.  
Suppose we have an input file RestCav.cdata containing a single curve named "cav" and 
an LV samples file RestLVMyo.cdata containing curves segment_1 through segment_20.</p>

<p>Generate a functional image file (results.cdata) via the command:</p>

<pre>
      jsfim -log fim.log -fgen RestCav.cdata Cin=cav fim.proj RestLVMyo.cdata &gt; results.cdata
</pre>

<p>results.cdata now contains 2 curves "P1" and "P2", each with 20 data points.
The results may be examined in a editor or other data analysis tools.  The means by
which the J4 system will display this data is still under development.</p>


<h3> <a name="I4">I4 Example Instructions</a> </h3>

<p> Let's assume you have a dynamic cardiac image file "heart" (I4 image format) and
associated ROI file "cardio.roi" containing ROIs lacav (left atrial cavity), lv (left
ventricle myocardium) and div (lv radial divider) to generate jsfim data files. Proceed
as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install I4 on your system, if it's not already there.</li>

<li> Use I4 to generate appropriate jsfim input data files:
<pre>
      // generate sample lacav
      //   the input curve is named "R1i1" with description "lacav"
      i4samp -tacin heart cardio.roi lacav &gt; lacav.tac

      // generate samples for each ring/sector
      //   the sample curves are named "R1s*" with descriptions "rs*_*"
      i4samp -bull -tac heart cardio.roi lv div &gt; lv.tac

      // you may wish to combine above tac files
      cattac -a lv.tac lacav.tac &gt; combined.tac
</pre>
</li>

<li>    Run jsfim to generate bullseye file results.bul one of two ways:
<pre>
      // this command uses two input files (lacav.tac and lv.tac)
      jsfim -log fim.log -fgen lacav.tac Cin=R1i1 -ofmt i4bull fim.proj lv.tac &gt; results.bul

      // this command uses the combined file (combined.tac) instead
      //  the -ref switch is required since data file contains both the input and sample curves
      jsfim -log fim.log -fgen Cin=R1i1 -ref rs -ofmt i4bull fim.proj combined.tac &gt;  results.bul

      // Note that the -fgen curve may be specified in the above commands
      // as either "R1i1" or "lacav"
</li>


<li>    Examine results in i4view:
<pre>
      i4view results.bul
</pre>
</li>
</ol>



<h4><a name="I4spec">I4 Input Data File Specifications</a></h4>

<p>I4 users usually need not concern themselves with details since "i4samp -bull -tac" 
automatically
generates a JSim readable TAC file that conforms to these specifications.  For those
interested in the technical details, the jsfim input dataset must contain the following 
items:</p>

<ul>
<li>z.ct : 0D curve containing the # of rings (Z planes) in the 
bullseye;</li>
<li>z.offset : 0D curve containing the Z offset from 0 of the 1st
ring;</li>
<li>s.ct : 0D curve containing the # of sectors in the bullseye;</li>
<li>rsR_S where R varies from 1 to z.ct and S varies from 1 to s.ct :
these contain reference data to match for the optimizer for each sector.
These curves are 1D in most cases,  although this is not strictly 
necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>    Note that JSim's TAC format data reader generates z.ct, z.offset and
s.ct from a FIM_FORMAT clause in the auxiliary data section.  The 
FIM_FORMAT clause is automatically generated via "i4samp -bul -tac".</p>
