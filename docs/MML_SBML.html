<h1>JSim and SBML</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> SBML is an XML based open standard for exchange of computer based 
mathematical models.  JSim imports SBML models by translating them to 
MML.  JSim can also export many MML models to SBML, although this 
functionality is somewhat limited because MML contains many mathematical 
constructs that have no corresponding construct in SBML.</p>
<p>JSim currently uses SBML library (libsbml) version: 5.13.0</p>

<h2>  <a name="import">Importing SBML Files into JSim</a></h2>

<p>To import an SBML model into JSim, select "Import model file" from 
the "Add" menu under the JSim GUI's "Project" tab.  SBML files have 
extension .xml or .sbml.  (Note that .xml is used by many XML-based 
files besides SBML, so be sure to pick a real SBML file.)  
Alternatively, you can load a SBML file via the -f switch on the command 
line of either jsim or jsbatch.</p>

<p>Note that some SBML features do not yet translate to MML.  In
this case,  warning comments will appear at the beginning of the 
generated MML.</p> 

<p>Push the "Compile" button to compile the model.  There is no 
guarantee that the code will compile successfully since SBML models are 
subject to the same sorts of formulation errors MML models are.  
Problems may also occur because JSim's SBML translator is not yet 
complete. See <a href="#import_bugs">SBML Import Bugs and Limitations</a> for
details.</p>

<p>Batch translation of SBML files to MML may be accomplished as 
follows:</p>
 
<pre>
jsbatch -f somemodel.xml -omml &gt; somemodel.mod
</pre>

<p>Windows users: If you are receiving errors from JSim concerning libSBML please see <a href="../download/win64.html#WindowsSBML">Installing JSim under MS Windows:  SBML, Antimony, and Matlab.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="export">Exporting SBML Files from JSim</a></h2>

<p>To export SBML from the JSim GUI, compile it, click on the model 
"Debug" tab and select "View SBML" from the "View" menu.  Translated 
SBML will appear in the text area.  If any warnings are generated in 
the translation, a button "Show N translator warnings" will appear. 
Clicking this button will display the warnings in the JSim message
area (right half of GUI).</p>

<p>To export SBML from the command line,  use the "-osbml" switch
in <a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a>:</p>

<pre>
jsbatch -f somemodel.mod -osbml &gt; somemodel.xml
   or
jsbatch -f somemodel.proj -osbml &gt; somemodel.xml
</pre>

<h2>  <a name="stat">Project Status</a></h2>

<p>The SBML translator is now quite robust, correctly translating and
simulating the 812 models in the <A
HREF="http://sbml.org/Facilities/Online_SBML_Test_Suite">SBML test suite</a> 
with the 'component' tags:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Algebraic rules</LI>
  <li>Assignment rules </li>
  <li>Compartments</li>
  <li>CSymbolAvogadro</li>
  <li>CSymbolDelay</li>
  <li>CSymbolTime</li>
  <li>FunctionDefinition</li>
  <li>InitialAssignment</li>
  <li>Parameter</li>
  <li>RateRule</li>
  <li>Reaction</li>
  <li>Species</li>
  <li>StoichiometryMath</li>
</ul>
<p>and/or the 'test tags':</p>
<ul>
  <li>0D-Compartment</li>
  <li>Amount</li>
  <li>AssignedConstantStoichiometry</li>
  <li>AssignedVariableStoichiometry</li>
  <li>BoundaryCondition </li>
  <li>Concentration </li>
  <li>ConstantSpecies</li>
  <li>ConversionFactors </li>
  <li>HasOnlySubstanceUnits </li>
  <li>InitialValueReassigned </li>
  <li>LocalParameters </li>
  <li>MultiCompartment </li>
  <li>NonConstantCompartment </li>
  <li>NonConstantParameter </li>
  <li>NonUnityCompartment </li>
  <li>NonUnityStoichiometry </li>
</ul>

<p>But excluding the following tags and concepts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Events (all tags with 'Event' in them)</li>
    <li>FastReaction</li>
    <li>The MathML constructs &lt;factorial&gt;, &lt;xor&gt;, &lt;infinity&gt;,
&lt;notanumber&gt;, &lt;true&gt;, and &lt;false&gt;</li>
    <li>Delay equations that rely on variables changing before the simulation begins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, JSim correctly translates and simulates 812 cases from the test
suite (in all SBML levels and versions), and does not fully simulate or
translate the 299 cases with the above elements (mostly events).</P>

<h2><a name="import_tech">SBML Import Technical Details</a></h2>

<p>SBML models are converted to MML with unit conversion off.  Any
required unit conversion factors must be part the original SBML 
equations.</p>

<p>The MML variable "time" is used to represent modeling time, regardless of
what name or names it may be known as in the original SBML.</p>

<p>The translator creates one variable per species, reaction, parameter,
compartment, and named species reference (stoichiometry).  If the units of
those variables are set (whether explicitly or by default) those units will be
translated to their most compact form using nsrunit.  If the variable is
found to change, it will be defined to vary in the 'time' domain in JSim.
Initial values or formulas for these variables are set using the 'when
(time=time.min)' construct. </p>

<p>Any Reaction in SBML becomes a variable in JSim that varies over the 'time'
domain. Its value is set to equal the 'kinetic law' of the reaction. These
reaction variables are then used to construct the ODEs for the species they
contain. The rate of change for each species over time (species:time) is set
to the sum of the reactions in which it is produced, less the sum of the
reactions in which it is consumed, each multiplied by the stoichiometry of
that species in that reaction.</p>

<p>When a species is defined to be interpreted as a <i>concentration</i> within
the model, the reactions in the model nonetheless define how the species 
<i>amount</i> changes in time.  Therefore, the rates of change for these species 
are defined as '(species*compartment):time'.  The math of this construct
works out to properly simulate the model even when the compartment volume
is not '1', or if it changes over time.</p>

<p>SBML models may also contain 'assignment rules' (formulas assigned to
variables which must be true at all points during the simulation), 'rate
rules' (formulas defining directly how an element changes over time) and
'algebraic rules' (formlas which must be true at all points during the
simulation, but which may end up being used to determine any of the involved
variables). All three are translated directly to JSim, with assignment rules
becoming 'variable=formula', rate rules becoming 'variable:time=formula' and
algebraic rules becoming 'formula=0'.</p>

<p>Finally, SBML models may define functions, which are translated to JSim on
a case-by-case basis.  In other words, if SBML defines a function func(x,y) =
2x+3y, and uses it two different times, (func(p, q) and func(z, w)), the
translator will expand those two calls individually to 'func.call0' and
'func.call1', which in turn will be defined as '2p+3q' and '2z+3w',
respectively.</p>

<p>When translating formulas in any of the above scenarios, delays in SBML
equations that define a delay 'd' for a variable 'X' are translated into the
JSim form "X(if (time&lt;d) time.min else time-d)"</p>

<p>The translator defines 3 <a href="MML_Topics.html#help">variable
properties</a> to provide SBML contextual information. The defined properties
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sbmlName: the "name" clause from SBML species, parameter, and 
compartment tags;</li>
<li>sbmlRole: one of "species", "compartment", "parameter", and "rate";</li>
<li>sbmlCompartment: the compartment ID for species variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to MML keywords and namespace limitations, some SBML variables
may be renamed in the MML translation.  If so, an appropriate warning 
message appears at the beginning of the translated MML.</p>

<h3><a name="import_bugs">SBML Import Bugs and Limitations</a></h2>

<p> SBML "event" tags are not yet supported.  The event will be ignored 
and the translator will insert a warning message in the resulting MML. </p>

<p> SBML has the concept of a 'fast reaction' (a reaction which goes to
completion instantly) which is currently untranslatable to JSim. Translations
of models containing reactions of this type will result in a warning message
in the MML.</p>

<p> The following MathML elements may appear in SBML models, but are not (yet)
translatable to JSim: &lt;factorial&gt;, &lt;xor&gt;, &lt;infinity&gt;, and
&lt;notanumber&gt;. Formulas with these elements are not translated to MML at
all, with a warning message resulting in the MML.</P>

<p> The MathML constructs &lt;true&gt; and &lt;false&gt; are translated to
MML, but the MML parser does not yet recognize them as valid boolean 
constructs.  When the parser is updated, these translated constructs will
succeed.</p>

<p> SBML has the concept of 'values that change before the simulation begins'
which is currently untranslatable to JSim.  Delay equations that rely on this
feature will produce unexpected results.  Only models that utilize the 'delay'
construct in SBML are potentially affected by this limitation.

<p>The mapping from SBML variable name to MML variable name (required due to
JSim reserved words and namespace limitations) is theoretically imperfect.
For example, SBML models with two distinct id's differing only in an initial
underscore (e.g.  ADG and _ADG) will not be translated correctly.  However, it
works for all models in databases so far tested.</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="export_tech">SBML Export Technical Details</a></h2>

<p>JSim elements are translated into SBML parameters, rules, and initial
assignments.  Even if the model was originally SBML, having species and
reactions, the current translator does not attempt to reconstruct those
species and reactions.</p>

<p>All JSim variables become SBML parameters.  If those variables varied over
time, the SBML parameter is set 'constant=false', and set 'constant=true'
otherwise.  If the initial value of the parameter was a double, that double is
used as the 'value' of the parameter; otherwise, the formula is used in an
initial assignment to that parameter.</p>

<p>Rates of change for variables become SBML 'rate rules' that assign to the
variable.</p>

<p>Formulas that define the value for a variable over all time become SBML
'assignment rules' that assign the given formula to the variable.</p>

<p>'Delay equations' in JSim of the form "X(if (time&lt;delay) time.min else
time-delay)" or similar are translated to SBML using the csymbol 'delay'.</p>

<h3><a name="export_bugs">SBML Export Bugs and Limitations</a></h2>

<p>This following JSim constructs can not be exported to SBML, and you will
get a warning message:</p>

<UL>
 <LI> <b>Multiple domains</b>.  Heuristics are defined to guess which domain
 should be used for SBML implicit time, but any domains beyond that one, and
 formulas that include constructs involving multiple domains, will be
 ignored.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Events</b>.  JSim events are conceptually incompatible with SBML
 events, and are not translated.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Formulas involving rates of change</b>.  It is possible to define a
 rate of change in SBML, but not to then use that in another equation (y =
 x:t).  In JSim, rates of change can even be determined implicitly by their
 use in such equations.  In a future version of the translator, these formulas
 may be abstracted to separate variables and used intead, but for now, the
 translator does not attempt to translate these formulas.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Subvariables</b>.  It is possible in JSim to define variables of the
 type X.Y, adding a semantic connection between that variable and 'X'.  It is
 theoretically possible to 'flatten' these types of variables for translation
 to SBML, but the current translator does not attempt to do so, and any such
 variables (and formulas that contain those variables) will be ignored.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Partial differential equations</b>.  Because SBML does not (yet)
 allow multiple domains, any attempt to define partial differential equations
 will be ignored by the translator.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Procedures</b>.  JSim constructs that call external functions (blocks
 of Java or C code, for example) can not be translated to SBML, and are
 ignored.</LI>
 <LI> <b>State variables</b>.  State variables are a part of JSim's event
 handling, and are not yet translatable to SBML.</LI>
 <LI> <b>Integration</b>.  JSim constructs involving integration can not be
 translated to SBML, and are ignored.</LI>
