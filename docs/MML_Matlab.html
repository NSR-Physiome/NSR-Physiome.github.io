<h1>Connecting JSim and Matlab</h1>



<p><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a> is a matrix-based
computational system distributed by The MathWorks(Natick, MA) and widely
used for scientific computation.  This document discusses several ways to
use <a href="../index.html">JSim</a> and Matlab in conjunction to solve
scientific problems.  Both JSim and Matlab offer possibilities for graphic
data display, however this document will focus on combining the
computational power of the two products.</p>

<h2><a name="model">Exporting JSim models to Matlab</a></h2>

<p>JSim (version 2.07 and above) allows you to export JSim models to Matlab .m
files. In the JSim GUI,  select the model "Debug" tab and then select 
"View Matlab" from the "View" menu.  Select "Export text..."  from the "File"
menu to write the Matlab text to a file, which should have extension ".m".
For command-line translation,  use the
<a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a> -omatlab switch, for example:</p>

<pre>
jsbatch -f input.proj -omatlab &gt; output.m
jsbatch -f input.mod -omatlab &gt; output.m
jsbatch -f input.sbml -omatlab &gt; output.m
</pre>

<p>Here is an example of how to use the Matlab model export.  Consider 
the following model:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Matlab/mml2matlab.mod"); ?>

<p>Launch the applet above, or download the model and, using either JSim or jsbatch
(version 2.07 and above),  follow the instructions above to generate Matlab
output in file "mytest.m".</p>

<p>To run the model in Matlab, you must write Matlab code that calls "mytest.m"
with parameters for  the time span you want the model to run, the name of the
ODE solver, and options for the ODE solver. Choices for the ODE solver are
ode45, ode23, ode13 for non-stiff problems and ode15s, ode23s, ode23t, and
ode23tb for stiff problems. If you wish to plot the results,  you must write
explicit Matlab commands to do so.  See Matlab help for details. For
example:</p>

<pre>
options = odeset('RelTol',1e-12,'AbsTol',1e-9);
[t x rInfo] = mytest( linspace(0,1,101),@ode23,options);
clf;
plot(t,x,'k')
title('Exponential Decay')
xlabel('Time, sec')
ylabel('Concentration, mM')
</pre>


<p><b>Limitations:</b> JSim Matlab export is currently implemented by
translating JSim model code first to SBML, and then using the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/sbml2matlab/"> sbml2matlab</a> tool to translate
SBML to Matlab.  There is potential for information loss in both translation
stages.  Limitations of the JSim to SBML translation process are described <a
href="MML_SBML.html#export_bugs">here</a>,  while limitations of sbml2matlab
are described <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/sbml2matlab/wiki/Usage">here</a>. At present,
JSim Matlab output works best for single-domain ODE models with no events or
implicit equations.  Note that only the default values of model parameters are
exported.</p>

<p>Windows users: If you are receiving errors from JSim concerning libSBML and Matlab code generation, please see <a href="../download/win32.html#WindowsSBML">Installing JSim under MS Windows:  SBML, Antimony, and Matlab.</a>

<h2><a name="data">Exporting JSim data to Matlab</a></h2>

<p>JSim model numeric data may be exported as Matlab .m format.  See details
in <a href="User_DataSets.html">Data Files and Project Data Sets</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="prog">Programatic interaction between JSim and Matlab</a></h2>

<p>There is no single "best" way to connect two software products, such 
as JSim and Matlab, that is best in all circumstances.  Different 
approaches have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of 
simplicity, flexibility, performance and long-term viability.  The 
importance of such tradeoffs will vary depending upon the problem at 
hand and the resources (time, compute power, personnel) available. This 
document will examine several approaches to JSim/Matlab connectivity, 
their strengths and weaknesses, and illustrate each approach with 
working examples.  All the examples here require you have both JSim and 
Matlab installed on your computer.  The examples do not work via JSim 
WWW applets.</p>

<p>Understanding numeric data file formats is vital to making many 
JSim/Matlab connections.  JSim supports a variety of data formats. It is 
often simplest to write "columnar data format" (AKA tab-separated text) 
from Matlab for import into JSim, and write either "columnar data 
format" or "Matlab (.m) format" from JSim for import into Matlab.  See 
<a href="User_DataSets.html">Data Files and Project Data Sets</a> for 
further information on supported data formats.</p>

<p>For long automated analyses, it is usually best to dispense with the 
engine's graphic user interface(GUI), which can take a signficant time 
to initialize.  The <a href="Devel_Batch.html">jsbatch</a> program 
provides command-line access to the JSim engine.  The user should study 
the various jsbatch switches to understand the available options. The 
-nosplash and -nodesktop switches provide access to Matlab without 
starting the GUI.  For further details,  see the Matlab user 
documentation.</p>

<p>Computational analyses utilizing JSim and Matlab may be classified 
based upon who is the master, and who is the slave.  The master may be 
either JSim, Matlab or an external agent (for example, the user).  For 
further information,  see the design of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#extern_master">External master, JSim and Matlab slaves</a></li>
<li><a href="#jsim_master">JSim master, Matlab slave</a></li>
<li><a href="#matlab_master">Matlab Master, JSim slave</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="extern_master">External master, JSim and Matlab 
slaves</a></h2>

<p>In this design,  the user (or some program acting as his/her agent)
launches JSim and Matlab alternately,  passing the output files of
one program to the input of the other.  This design is 
is very simple and quick to implement,  although performance may not
be ideal due to the multiple launches of the two engines.</p>

<h3>Example using bash script as master</h3>

<p>This example models a cell with two genes (gene1 and gene2) and two 
chemical species (A and B).  Gene1 controls the concentration of B,
given the concentration of A.  Gene2 control the concentration of A,
given the concentration of B.  The problem is to find the equilibrium
concentration when both genes are active.</p>

<p>The bash script below alternately calls the gene1 and gene2 
models, passing the results back and forth,  until the concentrations
stabilize.</p>

<a href="../examples/MML_Matlab/example1.sh">Example 1 bash script</a>

<p>Gene1 is a JSim model,  calculating B from A:

<a href="../examples/MML_Matlab/gene1.mod"> gene1.mod </a></p>

<p>Gene2 is a Matlab model,  calculating A from B:

<a href="../examples/MML_Matlab/gene2.m"> gene2.m</a></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>While gene1 and gene2 are very simple in this case,  this same 
approach would work just as well for arbitrarily complex models.</li>
<li>The numerical approach used by the bash script is simplistic and
may be numerically unstable for some models.  Users should use numerical
approaches appropriate to the models they are attempting to 
connect.</li>
<li>There is significant overhead of launching JSim and Matlab for each 
iteration.  Whether this overhead is "acceptable",  depends on the 
details of the analysis being done.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="jsim_master">JSim master, Matlab slave</a></h2>

<p>In this design, a JSim MML model embeds procedural code to call a
Matlab process to solve some model variables.  The MML constructs for this
embedding are called functions and
procedures.  For information on writing Matlab-specific functions and
procedures see <a href="MML_Func_Matlab.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="matlab_master">Matlab Master, JSim slave</a></h2>

<p>In this design, Matlab will control the JSim computational engine be 
using
either the jsbatch program or JSim's external API.</p>

<p>In the jsbatch scenario, Matlab will generate JSim readable model
and/or numeric data files and pass them, via switch setting to a jsbatch
run.  When jsbatch terminates, the Matlab then reads the appropriate
jsbatch output files for further processing.</p>

<p>The JSim external API scenario is more complex, but (potentially) 
more computationally efficient.  In this scenario a JSim engine in 
instantiated via a Matlab Java or C API, and is then called multiple 
times by subsequent Matlab processing.  This approach saves the overhead 
of loading Java, jsbatch and compiling the model before each model run. 
The JSim API for doing this is undergoing an overhaul at present, due to 
the desire to make additional JSim functionality to various external 
software systems (especially finite-element and CFD modeling).  A 
complete working example of the JSim API scenario will be provided once 
this overhaul is complete (expected fall 2008).</p>

<h3>Example calling jsbatch from Matlab for Monte Carlo analysis</h3>

<p>This example performs a simple Monte Carlo analysis. A Matlab mfile 
generates a set of sinusoidal data curves containing a small amount of 
random noise.  Each curve is sent to jsbatch, which optimizes a 
model(monte1.proj) to best fit the data curve by varying the sinusoidal 
amplitude (parameter amp).  After each optimization, Matlab collects the 
optimized values into an array and performs simple statistical analyses 
on them (calculating mean and variance).</p>

<p>The Matlab control script is as follows:<br />

<a href="../examples/MML_Matlab/monte1.m"> monte1.m </a></p>

<p>The JSim project,  containing the model and optimization 
configuration my be downloaded below.<br />

<a href="../examples/MML_Matlab/monte1.proj"> monte1.proj </a></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>This example presents only the simplest of possible Monte Carlo 
techniques.  A thorough discussion of Monte Carlo techniques is
beyond the scope of this document.</li>
<li>While the example model is small and fast, optimization of complex
models can take a fair amount of time.  In such cases,  the overhead for
reloading JSim for each optimization run may be insignificant.</li>
<li>The jsbatch command uses the -rm switch to remove the existing 
data set, before inserting the new noisy data set for optimization.</li>
<li>The jsbatch command uses the -ofmt switch to select an output
data format that is easy for Matlab to parse.</li>
<li>The example above has been tested only on under Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example calling JSim engine API from Matlab</h3>
<p><em>This example will be provided once revisions to the JSim API
are complete (TBD).
