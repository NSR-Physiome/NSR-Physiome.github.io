<h1>JSim Memory Usage</h1>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>JSim allows users to create arbitrarily large models, which can tax a 
computer's memory and cause various problems.  There are two methods for dealing
with these problems - either by increasing the total memory available to 
JSim or by reducing the memory needed during a model run via 
<em>every Nth point storage</em>. This document provides information about these two
approaches.</p>

<h2>  <a name="over">General Memory Considerations</a></h2>

<p>    Writers of large JSim models may need to be aware of system memory 
limitations.  Real data in JSim models occupy 8 bytes per grid point,
thus a model with 3 variables u(t), v(t), w(t) where t has 1000 grid 
points will occupy 3 x 8 x 100 = 24KB of storage.  Variables with 
multiple dimensions quickly eat up memory.  A variable u(x,t),  where
x and t both have 1000 grid points will occupy 8 x 1000 x 1000 = 8MB.
Model runs with multiple inner and outer loops cause storage requirements
to grow with the number of model runs.</p>

<p>    Running a JSim model when insufficient memory is available will result
in various failures.  Often failures will occur during a model run, or
when attempting to display large amounts of tabular data text.  In these
common cases, JSim should give a coherent error message, allowing you to
save your work and restart JSim with more memory.  However, memory
overflow in a severely taxed system may occur in any part of the program,
causing inexplicable crashes and/or freezes, so if you have reason to
believe you are bumping your head on the memory ceiling, it is a good idea
to restart with more memory to give JSim ample work space.</p>

<h2>  <a name="ceiling">Setting JSim's Memory Ceiling</a></h2>

<p> JSim runs inside the Java Virtual Machine(JVM), which defines at 
startup the maximum amount of memory that may be used.  JSim, by default, 
starts the JVM with enough memory to run most models.  This amount is a 
maximum of 1500MB on Linux and Macintosh and 1200MB on Windows.  (Most 
Windows installations can run successfully with 1500MB, but at least one 
machine tested failed when more that 1200MB were requested). Memory is 
dynamically assigned, so having a large maximum will not necessarily 
monopolize system resources.  However, if the memory assigned exceeds the 
system's physical memory, thus requiring paging to virtual memory, JSim 
performance can sag noticably.  Also, placing an unrealistically large 
limit can allow renegade models to monopolize system resources.  In severe 
cases, this can crash or freeze your operating system.  Therefore, you 
should be cautious changing JSim's memory allocation.</p>

<p>The mechanisms for setting JSim's memory ceiling are different for each
operating system:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="#linux">Information for Linux Systems</a></li>
<li>  <a href="#macos">Information for MacIntosh Systems</a></li>
<li>  <a href="#win32">Information for Windows Systems</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>  <a name="linux">Setting JSim' Memory Ceiling on Linux Systems</a></h3>

<p> JSim memory usage is controlled by the JSIMMEM environment variable, 
which represents the maximum number of megabytes of memory allowed.  The 
default value is 1500 (600 in JSim 2.06 and earlier).  Here is an 
example for the C-shell setting JSim's memory allocation to 3GB: 
<pre>
      setenv JSIMMEM 3000
      jsim
</pre>
</p>

<h3>  <a name="macos">Setting JSim's Memory Ceiling on MacIntosh Systems</a></h3>

<p>When running from the command line, the above comments for Linux 
apply.  Memory for the double-click JSim application is set via the Java 
"VMOptions" directive in Info.plist.  Info.plist may be found in the 
Contents subdirectory of the JSim application directory.  To change the 
default allocation, exit JSim, open the command-line tool, cd to the 
JSim application directory (it will have suffix .app), cd to Contents 
and use your favorite text editor to change the default value of 
"-Xmx1500m" (1500 MB) to a more appropriate value.</p>

<h3>  <a name="win32">Setting JSim's Memory Ceiling on Windows Systems</a></h3>

<p>    JSim memory usage is set by JSIMMEM variable inside your jsim.bat or
jsbatch.bat executables.  These files are located in the win32\bin (or win64\bin)
directory in your JSim installation directory. If you are not sure where
JSim is installed on your system, consult your system administrator.  You
may edit these batch files in a text editor, changing the following line, as is
appropriate:
<pre>
      set JSIMMEM=1200  
</pre>
</p>

<h2>  <a name="nth">Using Every Nth Point Storage</a></h2>

<p>Every Nth Point Storage (ENPS) may be selected in a model's "Memory" tab, which 
available in JSim version 2.09 and above.  The "Data storage" switch is set to 
"all points" by default.  When the user changes the switch to "every Nth point", 
an integer control becomes visible for every realDomain in the model.  This 
control has a default value of 1, meaning that all points for the domain are 
returned.  If the value for domain x is set to N, then only every Nth point of 
that domain is stored, thus reducing the needed memory for variables with domain x 
by a factor of N.</p>

<p>ENPS implementation has changed over recent JSim versions.  While the ideal is 
to only store every Nth point (thus reducing run-time memory requirements) some 
MML constructs (described below) are, as present, incompletely supported.  To 
ensure uniform user operation, JSim currently switches automatically between 
run-time ENPS and query-time ENPS.  Run-time ENPS store only every Nth point 
during run-time, while query-time ENPS stores all points internally, but only 
returns every Nth point to the user (e.g. for graphing).  Implementation of 
run-time vs. query-time ENPS varies across recent JSim versions:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>JSim version 2.15 and above:</b> JSim detects the presence of MML 
constructs problematic for ENPS (see below), and uses an appropriate combination 
of run-time and query-time ENPS to ensure returned results are identical to those 
created without ENPS. JSim's switching between run-time and query-time ENPS is 
currently implemented on a "by domain" basis.  That is, each realDomain in a model 
is tagged to use either run-time or query-time ENPS depending upon model
calculations.</li>

<li><b>JSim version 2.14:</b> JSim uses query-time ENPS in all cases.  This 
approach ensures identical results to those created without ENPS,  but with no
memory savings.</li>

<li><b>JSim version 2.09 to 2.13:</b> JSim uses run-time ENPS in all cases.
The approach consitently reduced run-time memory requirements,  but the results
are not guaranteed to be identical to those created without ENPS.</li>

</ul>

<p>The following MML constructs are currently problematic for run-time ENPS:</p>

<ul>

<li>PDE spatial domains;</li>

<li>Domains of dynamic inputs (e.g. function generators);</li>

<li>Domains of ODE variables if #dimension > 1;</li>

<li>Domains of PDE variables if #dimension > 2;</li>

<li>Domains of any variable queried at any time other than the current 
value or t.min.  Examples include, integral(),  sum(), delay lines, variable
function calls, MML procedures with use the @ operator.</li>

</ul>

<p>We continue to work on the JSim run-time engine.  It is our hope that, with 
further improvement, some or all the above problematic constructs can be rendered 
unproblematic. Note: We have found one model that shows very minor differences (at 
the 8th digit of significance) in results when ENPS is activated.  It is possible 
this points to a larger problem.  We continue to examine this issue.</p>

<p>ENPS controls are part of a JSim Parameter Set.  The name for the "Data storage"
switch is "memory.storeGrids" and the name for the Nth control for domain "t" is
"memory.t.nth".  These values may be viewed in any parameter set tab saved in 
release 2.09 or above.  If you wish to loop over the Nth value,  it is recommended
you first use the GUI to set the "Data storage" switch to "every Nth point", and
then loop over the parameter "memory.t.nth" (adjusted for the name of the domain).</p>
