<h1>Implicit Equations in MML</h1>



<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>    This document describes using implicit equations within JSim MML
models.  Implicit equations refer to equations in which the unknown
variable(s) are not isolated on one side of the equation, but are
intermixed with other known and unknown variables.  

<p>    Implicit equations may be linear or non-linear and may involve one or
many unknown variables.  The number of equations must be the same as the
number of unknowns.  If it is less, the problem will be rejected as
underspecified.  If it is more, the problem will be rejected as
overspecified.  (There are cases where N+1 equations exactly specify N
unknowns, but JSim is not yet smart enough to recognize them.) Unknown
variables may have any number of domains, however all variables that are
solved together must have the same set of domains.</p>

<h2>  <a name="linear1">Linear Implicit Equations in One Variable</a></h2>
<p>    Linear implicit equations of a single variable are solved internally
by JSim via algebraic variable isolation.  JSim solves the following:</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit1.proj">Implicit example #1 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit1.proj"); ?>

<p>    by internally rearranging it as:
<pre>
      x = (y+b)/a;
</pre>
</p>

<p>    Therefore,  model writers should not hesitate to use the implicit form
of such equations if they express the underlying ideas more clearly.</p>
<h2>  <a name="linearM">Linear Implicit Equations of Multiple Variables</a></h2>
<p>    These problems are often call simultaneous equations.  For example:
</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit2.proj">Implicit example #2 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit2.proj"); ?>

<p>    JSim solves such problems via a matrix inversion operation.  If the 
equations are not independent,  the matrix will not be invertible and an
error will be generated at model run time. </p>
<h2>  <a name="ode">Linear Implicit Equations in ODEs</a></h2>
<p>    Linear implicit equations can be used to define the initial conditions
and/or state equations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  An
example involving initial conditions:</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit3.proj">Implicit example #3 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit3.proj"); ?>

<p>    When defining ODE state equations,  the derivates of the state
variables are treated as unknowns,  while the state variables themselves
are treated as knowns.  Implicit equations allow the simultaneous
calculation of several derivates:</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit4.proj">Implicit example #4 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit4.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="nonlinear">Non-linear Implicit Equations</a></h2>

<p>Consider a simple example with a single
unknown variable (<strong>x</strong>):</p>

<pre>
      realDomain t;
      real x(t);
      x^3 - t = 0;
</pre>

<p> This example yields <strong>x</strong> as the cube-root to 
<strong>t</strong>.  Easy pie.</p>

<p>    However, many non-linear implicit equations are trickier than the
above example because they may have no solution or multiple solutions.
Consider the following system:</p>

<pre>
      realDomain t;
      real x(t);
      x^2 = t;
</pre>

<p>    In this system, <strong>x</strong> has two possible solutions for all positive
<strong>t</strong> (<strong>x</strong>'s positive and negative square roots).  There is a
unique <strong>x</strong> solution at <strong>t=0</strong>, but no real <strong>x</strong> solution for
negative <strong>t</strong>. (Complex variables are contemplated in JSim's future,
but are not yet available).  At run time this model would generate an
error if <strong>t</strong> assumes any negative values.  For positive <strong>t</strong>,
<strong>x</strong> would be assigned to either the positive or negative square root
without guarantee as to which. In fact, some <strong>x</strong> may be positive
while others are negative.</p>

<p>    This unpredictability is often unacceptable in predictive modeling
situations.  In the example above, for instance, the modeler may always
desire the non-negative solution. In this particular case, it would be
trivial to rewrite the model as:</p>

<pre>
      x = sqrt(a);  // sqrt() always returns a non-negative value
</pre>

<p>    however, non-linear equations are often too complicated for
this approach to work.  </p>

<p>    To combat the unpredicability of multiple solutions, models may be
refined by using relational expressions to bound solution values.  
Supported relational operators are:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<" - less than;</li>
<li>"<=" - less than or equal to;</li>
<li>"~=" - approximately equal to (clarification follows);</li>
<li>">=" - greater than or equal to;</li>
<li>">" - greater than.</li>
</ul>

<p>    In the current case, an ideal respecification for a non-negative
solution for x would be:</p>
<pre>
      realDomain t;
      real x(t);
      x^2 = t;
      x &gt;= 0;
</pre>

<p>    Unfortunately, JSim's current numeric solvers are not quite
sophisticated enough to solve this problem as specified.  To understand
why, we need to look a little more closely at JSim's underlying numeric
solvers.</p>

<h2>  <a name="bound">Bounded and Unbounded Non-Linear Implicit Equations</a></h2>

<p> The JSim numeric engine distinguishes two cases of non-linear 
implicit equations.  Bounded problems are those in which the model 
specifies both a low bound (">" or ">=") and a high bound ("<" or "<=") 
for each variable to be solved.  Unbounded problems are those in which 
at least one variable to be solved is missing at least one bound.  
Bounded problems are, by default, solved via the simplex algorithm which 
uses the bounds explicitly to limit its search.  Unbounded problems are 
solved via the GGopt algorithm which does not use bounds at all.  </p>

<p> JSim currently does not have any algorithms to solve "semi-bounded" 
problems such as the above square-root problem with a low bound of 
<strong>"x>=0"</strong> but no upper bound.  As a consequence the model 
will be solved via the GGopt algorithm, which ignores the low bound 
during its calculations, and may possibly return a negative value.  
Therefore, the proper formulation for square-root model in to provide an 
upper bound in addition to a lower bound, turning it into a fully 
bounded problem which allows simplex to work properly.  The following 
reformulation should work properly for all positive 
<strong>t</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit5.proj">Implicit example #5 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit5.proj"); ?>

<p> JSim guarantees that any solution returned will satisfy all 
specified relations.  Therefore, if ggopt is used in problems containing 
bounds (either because the problem is semi-bound, or because the user 
specifies ggopt as the bounded solver control below) the returned value 
may or may not pass the relations tests.  If the returned value does not 
satify the required relation, an run-time error will result.  Summary of 
the three variants of the square-root model:</p>

<ul>
<li>unbounded:  x may return negative or positive;</li>
<li>semi-bounded:  x will return positive,  or an error will result;</li>
<li>bounded:  x will return positive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>  <a name="approx">The Approximately-Equals Relation</a></h2>

<p> The "~=" relation is currently used by JSim to give the simplex and 
GGopt numeric algorithms a starting value to search.  A good starting 
guess can significantly improve the performance of these algorithms. If 
there multiple solutions, the starting value contributes to which one is 
selected.  This often means that the selected solution will be the one 
closest to the starting value, <strong>but this is not always the case, 
so modelers should not rely upon it for stable models</strong>. </p>

<p> In the future, JSim may incorporate algorithms that find all 
solutions to a set of implicit equations and use the 
approximately-equals relation to pick the closest one.  Such algorithms 
are not yet available, however.</p>

<h2> <a name="controls">Non-Linear Solver Run-Time Controls</a></h2>

<p> Like the controls that govern ODE and PDE solvers, there are 
user-adjustable controls that affect non-linear implicit equation 
solvers.  (There are currently no user-adjustable controls for linear 
implicit equations).  This set of controls will be visible in the 
"Solvers" page of JSim's model run-time tab when a model requires them. 
The controls are detailed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>unbound</strong>: This controls which algorithm is used for unbounded
implicit equations.  Currently,  the only available algorithm is "ggopt",
but that may change in the future;</li>
<li><strong>bound</strong>: This controls which algorithm is used for bounded 
implicit equations.  The default is "simplex",  but "ggopt" is also 
available.  If ggopt is selected,  a run-time error will result if 
the returned value does not satisfy the specified bounds.</li>
<li><strong>errtol</strong>: This is the average root-mean-square error required
for the equations to be considered solved.  If the solvers cannot achieve
this level of accuracy,  a run-time error will result.  Decreasing this 
number will increase the accuracy of the solution,  but increase the 
probability of run-time error.  Increasing this number will decrease the
probability of run-time error,  but decrease solution accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>maxcalls</strong>: This number,  multiplied by the number of 
simultaneous variables to be solved,  gives to maximum number of function
calls to try in attempting to find a solution.</li>
<li><strong>maxiters</strong>: This number,  multiplied by the number of 
simultaneous variables to be solved,  gives the maximum number of 
ggopt iterations (which ggopt is used).</li>
<li><strong>eps</strong>: GGopt relative error.</li>
<li><strong>istep</strong>: Simplex initial step size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>  <a name="mult">Non-linear Implicit Equations in Multiple Variables</a></h2>

<p>    These problems are a straight-forward analogy of the single variable
case.  The following example finds points of intersection between
a simple parabola and the unit circle:</p>

<pre>
      real x, y;
      x^2 + y^2 = 1;
      y = x^2;
</pre>

<p>    Note that there are two solutions,  symmetric about the Y axis.</p>

<p>    If we were interested in only the positive X value, we could make this
a bound problem via:</p>
<p><a href="../examples/MML_Implicit/implicit6.proj">Implicit example #6 (project file).</a></p>
<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Implicit/implicit6.proj"); ?>

<p> Note that upper and lower bounds for each variable are required. 
Otherwise, the unbounded algorithm will be used, possible generating 
errors as explained above.</p>

<h2>  <a name="limit">Limitations</a></h2>

<p> JSim's current non-linear zero finders share non-reentrant native 
simplex and ggopt methods, meaning that models using them cannot run the 
model optimizer successfully.  Work is under way to correct this 
situation.</p>
