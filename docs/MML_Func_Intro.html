<h1>Using Functions and Procedures in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction </h2>
<p>    Functions and procedures are mechanisms for incorporating code from
procedural languages such as Java, C, C++, Fortran and Matlab into
MML models.  Some general principles are explained in this document, and
pointers to implementation of specific languages are provided. </p>


<p> Prerequisites: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="MML_Intro.html">Introductory Survey of MML</a>
(required)</li>
<li><a href="User_Intro.html">Introduction to the JSim
GUI </a> (recommended)</li>
<li>Familiarity with Java or C programming (recommended)</li>
</ul>

<p>    MML functions and procedures (F&P) provide mechanisms for
incorporating procedural code into MML models.  Functions treat all
arguments as inputs and return a real value.  Procedures have no return
value, but have both input and output arguments. To use a function or
procedure in an MML model, it must be defined and then called in an
appropriate context.</p>
<p>    There are three mechanisms for defining F&P.  Source F&P are defined
by source code embedded within an MML model, which is compiled at model
build time or run time.  Native F&P are defined by object code that has
been previously created by C, C++, Fortran or other native code compilers.  
Class F&P are defined by pre-compiled Java classes which are linked into
the model at run-time.</p>
<p>    Procedural code blocks within these F&P definitions must conform to the
relevant JSim Application Programmer's Interface (API) so that values
computed will properly communicate with the rest of the MML model and the
JSim application. </p>
<p>    However a function or procedure is defined, it doesn't do any useful
work until it is called one or more times in an appropriate context.  A
function may be used in any algebraic expression within an MML equation or
relation constraint.  A procedure may be used, standing by itself or
modified by a "when" clause, as an MML constraint.  The MML @ construct is
provided to ensure dimensional compatibility between F&P definition and
usage.  These concepts are illustrated by the examples that follow:</p>

<h2>  <a name="fp">Multiprocessing F&P</a></h2>

<p> JSim requires F&P used under <a 
href="User_MP.html">multiprocessing</a> (MP) to be reentrant, meaning 
that they can be called simultaneously in different contexts without 
crosstalk between the computational threads.  Writing reentrant code is 
technical and should be done only be expert programmers.  A complete 
description of reentrancy implementation techniques is beyond the scope 
of this document.  </p> <p> The JSim compiler (like virtually all other 
compilers) can't tell whether a function or procedure is reentrant by 
automated analysis.  The model author must tell it.  JSim assumes F&P 
are not reentant unless told otherwise.  However, telling JSim that a 
function or procedure is reentrant <strong>will not make it so</strong>.  
In fact, tagging a function or procedure reentant, when the code is not, 
in fact, reentrant, will typically crash not only the model but java and 
JSim itself in a truly spectacular way.  So <strong>never</strong> tag a 
function or procedure as reentrant unless you are <strong>very 
sure</strong> the underlying code is reentrant.  Standard warnings apply 
to you and your children to the seventh generation.</p>

<p>    Assuming you have a reentrant function or procedure you wish to
use under JSim MP,  you may tag it reentrant by adding the following
clause to the F&P declaration:
<pre>
      reentrant="true";    
</pre>
</p>
<p>    The following is a reentrant example using Java source F&P:</p>
