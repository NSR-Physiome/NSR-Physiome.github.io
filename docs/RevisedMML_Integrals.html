<h1>Using Integrals and Sums in MML</h1>

functions. </p>

<h2>  <a name="integrals">Integrals</a></h2>

<p>Integration of an integrand "expr" over realDomain t from t=lowbound to 
t=hibound is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
      integral(t=lowbound to hibound, expr)
</pre>

<p>Integration over the entire range of t (from t.min to t.max) may be written
compactly as:</p>
<pre>
      integral(expr@t) // same as integral(t=t.min to t.max, expr)
</pre>

<p>Simple examples of integral() are demonstrated below:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Integrals/integrals.proj"); ?>

<p> Here <strong>v(t)</strong> represents the integral of <strong>u</strong> up to the current time.  
<strong>w1</strong> and <strong>w2</strong> are calculated identically and represent the integral 
<strong>u</strong> over all time. All integrated variables will be assigned units m*sec, since an integral's 
units are the product of the units of the integrated quantity and the units of the variable of integration.  
Like other MML functions, integral() will generate unit conversion errors if it is used in an inappropriate 
context. The integral() is a first order approximation and approaches the true integral of <strong>u</strong> as t.delta -> 0 . This can be shown by letting <strong>z(t)</strong> represent the integral <strong>u</strong> over all time, expressed as an <a href="/jsim/docs/MML_ODE.html">ordinary differential equation (ODE)</a>, and running the model at ever smaller t.delta values. Note that the result of an integral obtained by an ODE equation is solver dependent (<a href="/jsim/docs/Solver_ODE_Guide.html">Euler accuracy is usually much worse than Radau)</a>. </p>

<p>    While integrating from t.min to t.max or from t.min to t are the most common
uses,  the integrals may be between any two values to t.  Also,  the expression
integrated need not be a simple variable, for example:</p>

<pre>
      integral(t=t.min+1 to t/2, u^2*exp(-v))
</pre>

<p>MML integral() can also be used to "integrate out" one domain of a multi-dimensional 
variable:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Integrals/integral2.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="sums">Sums</a></h2>

<p>The summation of a summand "expr" over realDomain t from t=lowbound to 
t=hibound is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
      sum(t=lowbound to hibound, expr)
</pre>

<p>Summation over the entire range of t (from t.min to t.max) may be written
compactly as:</p>
<pre>
      sum(expr@t) // same as sum(t=t.min to t.max, expr)
</pre>

<p>Simple examples of sum() are demonstrated below:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Integrals/sums.proj"); ?>

<p> Here <strong>v(t)</strong> represents the sum of <strong>u</strong> up to the current time.  
<strong>w1</strong> and <strong>w2</strong> are calculated identically and represent the sum 
<strong>u</strong> over all time. All summed variables will be assigned units m, since a sum's units are 
equal to those of the summand. Like other MML functions, sum() will generate unit conversion errors if 
it is used in an inappropriate context.</p>

<p>While summing from t.min to t.max or from t.min to t are the most common
uses,  sums may be between any two values to t.  Also,  the
summand need not be a simple variable, for example:</p>

<pre>
      sum(t=t.min+1 to t/2, u^2*exp(-v))
</pre>

<p>MML () can also be used to "sum out" one domain of a multi-dimensional 
variable:</p>
