    <h1>JSim Source Code Standards</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document describes coding standards for JSim Java source code.
It is intended for those contributing Java source code to the JSim CVS
archive.  JSim is a large program (currently about 80,000 lines),  so 
ensuring some uniformity of appearance is very helpful to those who 
must read and understand the code.  </p>
<p>    Since the present author (Erik Butterworth) wrote about 95% of the
existing code, the coding conventions described here are I follow.  I do
not to claim these to be the best of all possible conventions, only that
by following these conventions, JSim's code base will be more consistent,
and therefore more readable.</p>
<p>    This a my first try at this document.  It will, no doubt, evolve over
time.  Sun has done some <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">nice
work</a> on Java
conventions.  I urge readers to consider that document, which is much more
complete that this one here.  I do differ in some particulars, however.  
Ultimately,  JSim coding conventions will always be some blend of standard
conventions and JSim-specific conventions.</p>
<h2>  JSim Source Code Conventions</h2>
<p>    General conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ultimate is to produce efficient, readable and maintainable JSim
code.  Following conventions is only a means to that end.  Abandon a
convention if it obscures what is going on.  Writing clear code is an
ongoing problem not amenable to prescriptive solutions.  Conventions help
somewhat, however.</li>
<li>Class names should be of mixed case,  starting with a capital. Static 
final variables should be all caps.   Other variables should be
mixed case,  starting with a non-cap.  For example:
<pre>
      public class DogHouse {
          public final static int POLLFREQ = 200; //milliseconds
          public DogHouse fleaHotel;   // for Fido
          ...
</pre>
</li>

</ul>
<p>    Format and Indenting</p>

<ul>
<li>Code submitted to the JSim CVS archive should use Unix-style ASCII
text files (N/L terminated, no CR).</li>
<li>Line width should not exceed 80 characters. </li>
<li>Indent the next line after a left-brace.  The left-brace itself is
placed on the same line as the preceeding statement.  Close the brace
at the same indentation level as the line of the opening brace.  </li>
<li>Indent unbraced clauses after if(), while(), for(), etc. unless
the entire clause fits easily on a single line.</li>
<li>The first indentation is a single tab.  Further indentations are
four spaces. 8 spaces are assumed to be equivalent to a tab. Set your
editor's tab settings to 8 spaces when editing JSim code or it will
not be well aligned.</li>
<li>Long method bodies (over 50 lines) and highly indented code (e.g. 6 
levels) inhibit readability.  One solution is to break the code into 
manageable subroutines.  A better one is often to enhance the methods 
in the classes called.</li>

</ul>
<p>    Comments</p>

<ul>
<li>Double-slash comments are preferred over C-style except for extended
multiline comments.  This makes it easier to comment out large blocks of 
code (using C-style comments).  javadoc style comments are not used in 
JSim.</li>
<li>Every method should have a preceding comment describing it.
Most instance variables should have same-line comments describing them.
Long methods should be broken into paragraphs with preceding comments.
Comments should appear at least every 10 lines (or so) of a method.</li>
<li>Trivial temporary variables (such as integer counters) should NOT be 
commented.  Trivial comments clutter code and reduce readability.</li>

</ul>
<p>    JSim-specific conventions</p>

<ul>
<li>Become familiar with the general purpose utilities available in JSim
and reuse (possible enhance) existing ones rather than duplicating code.  
Especially useful are JSim.util.Util and JSim.util.StringList.  User 
visible numeric formatting should use JSim.util.PrettyFormat.</li>
<li>XML parsing is handled via Apache Xerces,  and is accessible via
PServer.parseXML().  Do not introduce other XML parsers into the system.
They are very bulky.  XML output can be handled by JSim.data.XMLWriter.</li>
<li>If you need a general-purpose language parser,  use JLex and CUP,
which are already packaged with JSim.</li>
<li>JSim packages should contain no more that about 50 class files to be
manageable.  A directory list of .java files in a package should produce
no more than one page of output on a standard terminal.  If things are
getting too large, consider combining classes, pruning, or making
sub-packages.</li>
<li>Java source files over 500 lines are difficult to read, and not
really needed to meet JSim design requirements.  Java class files under 50
lines are usually trivial, unless they are placeholders for future code,
or simple extensions to more substantive classes.  Ideally readable files
hover between 50 and 300 lines.</li>
<li>Class names should be chosen unique enough so that they can be 
called without qualification (e.g. MyClass not JSim.mypackage.MyClass)
within the JSim code base.</li>
<li>Consult with the programming lead before introducing any third
party software into the JSim base to make sure license terms are 
compatible with JSim's distribution requirements.</li>
<li>JSim should run indentically (so far as possible) on all platforms.
Java provides mechanisms for doing things (e.g. File names) in a platform
independent way.  Use them.  Avoid native methods and underlying operating 
system calls except when absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Do not use deprecated methods or classes.  Exceptions are made for
essential features that are not available elsewhere: Thread.kill() and
Sun's embedded java compiler sun.tools.javac.Main.</li>
<li>If you are not an NSR employee,  a license agreement must be made
between your institution and the University of Washington,  to allow NSR
to distribute your code with JSim.  It is not sufficient for you to give
your personal agreement.  The agreement must be made between institutions.</li>

</ul>
