<h1>Introduction to the JSim Optimizers</h1>



<h2>Preface</h2>

<p> JSim's model parameter optimizers are automated tools for finding 
model parameter values which cause model output to best match fixed 
reference data.  This document provides step-by-step instruction for 
operating the optimizers.</p>

<h2>  <a name="over">Overview</a></h2>

<p> Suppose you wish to match output from a given model to data taken 
from a scientific experiment.  The general process is as follows:</p>

<p> 1) Create a data file with the experimental results and import it 
into the project that contains your model (see <a 
href="User_DataSets.html">Data Files and Project Data Sets</a> ).</p>

<p> 2) Decide which model outputs should best match which data curves.  
Typically this involves a bit of exploration of model parameter space 
using plot pages.</p>

<p> 3) Configure the model's "Optimizer" sub-tab with the parameters you 
wish to vary and the model outputs and data curves which should ideally 
match.</p>

<p> 4) Push the optimizer's "Run" button and watch as the optimizer 
works.  </p>

<p> 5) Examine optimizer results and model outputs at new optimized 
parameter values.  </p>

<h2>  <a name="start">Starting the tutorial</a></h2>

<h3>on your computer:</h3>

<ol>
<li>If you have not already done so, <a href="../download">download and
install JSim on your computer</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../examples/User/opt1.mod"> The model file for this
tutorial</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../examples/User/optdata1.tac"> The data file for this
tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Start JSim on your computer</li>
<li>Select "Import model file..." from the "Project" tab "Add" menu and 
load the opt1.mod model file.</li>
<li>Select "Import data file..." from the "Project" tab "Add" menu and 
load the optdata1.tac data file.</li>
</ol>



<h2><a name="model">Understanding the model</a></h2>

<p> Examine the model MML to see how it works.  Compile and run the model
and plot the output variable named "u", which represents exponential
decay.  u's values are controlled by the parameters "amp" and "decay",
both of which have 1 as a default value. Run the model with various values
of amp and decay to get a feeling for how they affect the affect u.  When
you are done, restore amp and decay to their default values. </p>

<p> Now superimpose the curve R1s1 from the data set optdata to the plot
containing u.  Alter plot colors or other characteristics so that you can
clearly distinguish between model output and fixed data.  Now run the
model varying amp and decay until you get a reasonable match between u and
R1s1.  This is the process the optimizer will automate.  Note that both
amp and decay must be altered from their defaults to get a reasonable fit.  
If you are confused about any of the above operations, you should
probably review the documents mentioned in the introduction.</p> 

<h2> <a name="setup1">A Sample Optimization</a></h2> 

<p> We will now setup the optimizer to automatically
perform the optimization you did "by hand" in the previous section.  
Restore amp and decay to their default values, and then select expon's
"Optimizer" sub-tab which configures an optimization run.  </p> 

<p> The configuration is divided vertically into three sections.  We'll
ignore the top section for now. Look at the "Parameters to Vary" section.  
Here is where we will specify that amp and decay are the parameters we
wish to vary.  Enter "amp" (no quotes) in the Parameter column or select
amp from a parameter list by clicking the down arrow button to the right
of the box.  The line will blacken showing the current value of amp (which
should be 1) in the Start column.  Fill in 0.5 and 5 in the Min and Max
columns to indicate the minimum and maximum values of amp you wish to
optimizer to consider.  The Step column prescribes in the initial absolute
(not relative) change in parameter value.  For this tutorial, the default
value is adequate.  Once all fields in the line have contents, a check box
will appear in the OK column.  Optimization of this parameter may be
temporarily disabled by unchecking the box.  A question mark will appear
in the OK column, if there is some problem with the line. Clicking on the
question mark will display a message telling what the problem is.</p>

<p> A second (blank) line will
have opened when you entered amp in the first line. Specify the parameter
decay in the second line as you did amp in the first.  Use the same min
and max values.  The "Parameters to Vary" section should now show two
blackened lines, and a third blank one.</p>

<p> Now look at the "Data to Match" section.  Here we will tell the
optimizer to get the best match it can between data curve R1s1 and model
output u.  The first column is the dataset from which to draw the data
curve.  Since your project contains only a single data set (optdata), it
will be automatically filled in.  If you use the optimizer in projects
with more than one data set, you will need to select which data set to
use.  In the "Curve" column enter "R1s1" no quotes or select it from the
popdown list.  The box should blacken.  In the "Par/Expr" column, enter
"u" (no quotes) or select it from the pop-down list.  The first line under
"Data to Match" should now be completely blackened and a check box should
appear in the OK column.  This checkbox (or the associated question mark)
function as their counterparts in the "Parameters to Vary" section. Ignore
the "Pwgt" and "Cwgt" columns for now.</p>

<p> The optimizer is now ready to be run.  Press the "Run" button in the
optimizer configuration menubar.  The optimizer works by running the model
for various parameter values, guessing after each run other values to try.  
In our case the model runs very quickly, so entire optimization run should
only take a few seconds.  Your plot page should now show good agreement
between model output and reference data.  The optimized values for amp and
decay are now shown in the "Start" column of the "Parameters to Vary"
section.  Note that the values are good, but not perfect.  Perfect values
would be amp=2 and decay=3.</p>

<h2> <a name="graph">Graphs and Reports</a></h2> 

<p> The "Optimizer" sub-tab, has three sub-sub-tabs along
the top margin.  The "Config" (sub-sub-)tab was used to configure the
optimization run.  Useful results from the most recent optimization run
can be viewed in the "Graph" and "Report" tabs.  The "Graph" tab has seven
different "View" options which should be fairly self-explanatory after you
see them once. The "Report" tab should also be easy to understand. Take a
few minutes to examine the graphs and report.<p>
<p>
When using JSim versions 2.16 and above, the Optimization report now includes RMS and relative RMS (RRMS) error for <em>individual</em> curves when multiple, simultaneous data curve fits are run (previously, the RMS was reported for only the entire collection of curve fits). This information can be useful when data curves differ by orders of magnitude or have different dimensions. The RRMS error is calculated by taking the indivdual curve fit RMS and dividing it by the weighted standard deviation of the data curve (<a href="RRMSEcalculations.pdf">RRMS calculation info)</a>. RRMS error is only reported on non-negative data. 
</p> 
<p>
One part of the report, that can be difficult to understand, is the "Condition number" 
which gives you an idea about how useful the confidence intervals for the given optimization are. 
Please see <a href="Solver_Condition_Number.html">JSim Optimization Report: 
Condition Number</a> for more details. Note that since we did no relative data
 weighting, the weighted and unweighted residual graphs are identical and 
the "Point weigths" graph contains nothing useful.</p> 
<p>All three Optimizer sub-tabs possess a "Run" button in the menubar.  
The results of the optimizer will be same in each case.  What will vary
will be the reporting the user receives as the optimizer works.  
Currently JSim does not support the user switching between different types
of feedback while the optimizer is running.</p> 

<h2> <a name="stop">Stopping Criteria</a></h2> 

<p> Return now to the optimizer's "Config" tab.  The top third, labelled
"Model Optimizer Configuration" controls the optimization algorithm to be
used, and the parameters controlling when the optimizater stops work.  
The optimizer almost never gets a perfect match between data and model
output.  Therefore, stopping criteria are provided to tell it when it has
done a "good enough" job.  </p>

<p>Some stopping criteria are common to all algorithms, while some are 
algorithm-specific.  Common stopping criteria are described below. See 
<a href="Solver_Optim_Ref.html">JSim Optimization Algorithms</a> for 
algorithm-specific details.</p>

<p> The common stopping criteria are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Max # runs:</strong>  The optimizer will stop if it has run the 
model this many times.</li>
<li><strong>Min RMS error:</strong>  The optimizer will stop if the mean RMS
error between reference data and model output is less than this value. The RMS
error is calculated as
<br><br>

<img style="border: 10px solid #FFF; border-width: 0 0 5px 0;"
    src="mimetex.cgi?
    \large


{\it RMS} = \sqrt {\frac {\sum _{j=1}^{k} \left( {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{{\it N_j}} \left( {\it Ydata_{ij}}-{\it Ymodel_{ij} }\right) ^{2} 
\cdot {\it PointWt_{ij}} \cdot {\it CurveWt_j}}
{\sum _{i=1}^{{\it N_j}}{\it PointWt_{ij}}}} \right) }  
{ \sum _{j=1}^{k}{\it CurveWt_j} }} 
    " align="middle" />

<p> where there are <i>j=1 to k</i> curves, each curve having a curve weight, <i>CurveWeight<sub>j</sub></i>, and having <i>i=1 to N<sub>j</sub> </i>data
points, <i>Ymodel<sub>ij</sub></i>, and corresponding point weights, <i> PointWt<sub>ij</sub></i>.
</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Min par step:</strong>  The optimizer will stop if it is considering
parameter values that vary less than this value.  </li>
</ul>

<p>    If unrealistic values for the stopping criteria are specified, 
the model optimizer may either run forever,  or stop before any useful
work is done.  You always have the option of cancelling a long 
optimization run,  and the best values so far calculated will be 
retained.</p>

<h2>  <a name="complex">Complications</a></h2>

<p>     Real world models and data will not fit so easily as in this 
idealized example.  This introduction serves only to show how to 
operate the JSim optimizer,  but does attempt to address the large 
scientific problem of how best to optimize parameters to reference 
data.  Future tutorials will address these issues.  Some complicating
factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Errors in mathematical formulation of models which no 
mere parameter adjustments can hope to compensate for.</li>
<li>Noisy data may good fits difficult.  Models may be expected
to fit multiple data curve.  Relative weighting of RMS error between
data points or data curves may be highly subjective.</li>
<li>Optimizer algorithms generally perform more and more poorly 
the larger the number of varying parameters.</li>

</ul>
