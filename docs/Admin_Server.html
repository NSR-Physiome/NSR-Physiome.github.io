<h1>Administering a JSim Server</h1>


<h2>  Introduction </h2>
<p>    This document describes how to run a JSim server, which allows JSim
clients (such and jsim and jsbatch) to run in remote mode, that is, to
perform their model calculations on a remote host rather than on their
local machine. The primary reasons for doing this are:</p>

<ol>
<li> The server may have more computational power,  allowing faster
calculation of models than is available on the local host;</li>
<li> The WWW applet version of JSim  must always use remote mode, since 
JSim's 
computational engine
relies, in part, on legacy C and Fortran numeric solvers that may not be
run in an applet.</li>

</ol>
<p>JSim server is available for Linux and MacOS and Windows.
This document assumes reasonable familiarity with Unix system and computer 
network administration. Windows administrators will need to translate the
directions appropriately for their systems.</p>

<h2>  <a name="how">How JSim Servers Work</a></h2>
<p>    JSim servers are based on Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
protocol.  A JSim server creates an RMI registry on a specified port (1099
by default), and registers an object (named JSimServer by default) that
responds to client connection requests.  A client in this case is a either
single instance of jsim or jsbatch run with the -server switch or an WWW
page containing the JSim applet.  If a client's connection request is
honored, a new client-specific server object (e.g. JSimServer.charlie0) is
registered to handle all further requests from the client (such as
building and running models).  When the client terminates, it sends a
disconnect request to the server, which removes the client-specific server
from the registry.</p>
<p>    Each client-specific server runs as a separate process (not a thread)
in a separate JVM.  The reasons for this are:</p>

<ol>
<li> Many native methods in the JSim numerical method library are not
thread safe, so multiple concurrent runs cannot be supported within a
single JVM.</li>
<li> It simplifies client memory management,  preventing one renegade
client from bringing down the entire server.</li>
<li> It allows the administrator to manage processes individually using
OS specific tools (e.g. ps on Linux/MacOS).</li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="manual">The jsserver Manual</a></h2>
<p>    JSim server administration is done with the jsserver program 
(jsserver.db for those of you using JSim source distributions).  Start
a server using the "-start" switch.  Stop the server with the "-stop"
switch.  A running server may be monitored with the -status switch
or by examining the logfile created in the server's work directory.</p>
<p>    Synopsis:
<pre>
      Usage: jsserver command [options]
      Commands:
        -start dir      start server in given work directory
        -stop           stop server
        -status         query server status
        -connect ID     create client connection (debug only)
        -disconnect ID  disconnect client
      Startup Options:
        -sandbox                run clients in safe sandbox  (default)
        -nosandbox              run clients without safe sandbox
        -purgeFreq number      specify uncommunicative client purge freq in secs (default 90)

      General Options:
        -name string    specify non-default server name
        -port number    specify server port (default 1099)
</pre>
</p>
<h3>    Commands</h3>
<h4>      -start directory</h4>
<p>        Start the server in the given work directory.  The work directory
must already exist.  This option runs in the foreground,  so you must
use operating-system appropriate methods to push it into the background
if that is what you desire.</p>
<h4>      -stop </h4>
<p>        Stop the server.  This disconnects all current clients 
immediately,  so be careful when you do it.</p>
<h4>      -status</h4>
<p>        Print status display of the server.</p>
<h4>      -connect ID</h4>
<p>        For developer debugging purposes only.</p>
<h4>      -disconnect ID</h4>
<p>        Disconnect a client.  May cause abrupt termination at
the client end.</p>
<h3>    Switches</h3>
<h4>      -port</h4>
<p>        Server port,  1099 by default.</p>
<h4>      -name</h4>
<p>        Server name, JSimServer by default.</p>
<h4>      -sharedJVM</h4>
<p>        For developer debugging purposes only. </p>
<h4>      -sandbox</h4>
<p>        Runs client models in the <a href="User_Sandbox.html">JSim Sandbox</a> .  This
is on by default.</p>
<h4>      -nosandbox</h4>
<p>        Runs client models without the JSim sandbox.  Never
do this unless you enable operating system level access control to 
the appropriate port,  insuring that only trusted hosts may access it.
Even then,  this may be a bad idea.</p>
<h4>      -purgeFreq number</h4>
<p>        Specifies how long (in seconds) a client connection is maintained
in the absence of stay-alive requests.  The default is 90.  Values less
than 60 are not allowed for performance reasons.</p>
<h4>      -maxConnectTime number</h4>
<p>        Specifies the maximum duration (in seconds) allowed for a client 
connection.  The default is 12 hours.  </p>
<h4>      -clientMax number</h4>
<p>        Specify maximum # of concurrent clients allowed. The default is 10.</p>
<h4>      -clientMemory number</h4>
<p>        Specify maximum client JVM memory in MB. The default is 600.  
This switch has no effect if -sharedJVM is also specified.</p>
<h4>      -maxBuildTime number</h4>
<p>        Specify timeout for model builds in seconds.  Model builds may sometimes
take arbitrarily long times to complete if they are underspecified.  The default is
120.</p>
<h4>      -maxRunTime number</h4>
<p>        Specify timeout of model runs in seconds.  The default is 3600 (1 hour).  
This feature does not work properly yet,  but remains an option for the future.</p>
<h4>      -userPort number</h4>
<p>        Specifies the minimum in a range of <strong>clientMax</strong>+1 dynamic
ports to be used by the server.  By default, arbitrary port numbers are
used.  This switch become useful when traversing a <a href="#firewall">firewall (see
below)</a> .</p>
<h2>  <a name="limit">Cautions/Limitations</a></h2>

<ol>
<li> A JSim server may not share an RMI registry with other RMI 
applications,  including other JSim servers.  One JSim server per port.
You do not need to (and should not) run Sun's "rmiregistry" program
on this same port.</li>
<li> A JSim server has no built-in access control.  Connecting clients
submit a username and password, but jsserver does not currently validate
these in any way.  The server does not allow disabling of connection from
potentially hostile internet sites.  Disabling such connections must be
done using appropriate operating-system or firewall mechanisms.</li>
<li> Make sure you understand the <a href="User_Sandbox.html">JSim sandbox</a> .
jsserver runs client models in the sandbox by default.  This may have the
unfortunate effect of disabling some valid models.  However,  running
in without the sandbox can leave you open to attack.  See comments 
regarding the -nosandbox switch above.</li>
<li> "jsim -server localhost" is NOT the same as "jsim".  The former
requires jsserver to be running on your local host.</li>
<li> Connections to JSim server from jsim and jsbatch occasionally
generate NullPointerExceptions on the initial model compile.  Work
continues to reproduce and fix this bug.  JSim GUI users can usually
continue work by simply pressing the model compile button.</li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="basic">Step-by-step Basic Server Administration</a></h2>
<p>    Here's what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li> Read this document in its entirety.  If you don't understand the
issues involved, maybe administrating a JSim server is not for you.  
There is no shame in this (unless you're a full-time system
administrator).</li>
<li> Create a non-privileged account (e.g. jsserver) to run the jsserver
program.  This can help protect you against jsserver bugs, security holes
(if any) and yourself.  Note: Under Windows, "non-privileged account" is
not really a functional concept, so this protection measure will be less
effective than in more security-oriented operating systems.  But then if
you were worried about security, you wouldn't be using Windows in the
first place.</li>
<li> Obtain a recent JSim distribution, and <a href="Admin_Custom.html">customize
it</a> appropriately, taking special care to understand
the JSim sandbox.  Install this under the jsserver user account.</li>
<li> Decide on a port number to run the JSim service from.  The default
(1099) usually best, since it simplifies user connections.  Make sure
there are no conflicts in your system or network (especially firewalls)
for this port.</li>
<li> Decide on a name for the JSim server in the RMI registry.  The
default (JSimServer) is almost always the right choice, since it
simplifies user connections.</li>
<li> Create a work directory for your server (e.g. ~jsserver/WORK).</li>
<li> Launch the jsserver (make sure you're in your new jsserver
account!).  For initial testing you might want to run it in the
foreground.  Once you're comfortable with its operation, you'll probably
want to run it in the background.  Using the default settings and the
example work directory above the command would be:
<pre>
      jsserver -start ~/WORK
</pre>
</li>
<li> Check on the status of the server periodically by examining 
the logfile (e.g. ~/WORK/logfile) or by using the command:
<pre>
      jsserver -status
</pre>
</li>
<li> Test a connection to your server (see below).</li>
<li> When it is time to say good-bye:
<pre>
      jsserver -stop
</pre>
</li>
<li> Depending upon server usage,  you may need to clean out the 
jsserver work directory every so often.  If you're clever,  you might
even figure out how to do this automatically.  Be sure the server
is not running when you do this.</li>
<li> Once you're happy with your server,  you'll need to inform 
potential users of its location and availability.  Since they may be
unfamiliar with connecting to a remote server,  you may need to help
them out (see below).  </li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="connect">Connecting to a JSim Server</a></h2>
<p>    You may connect to a JSim server using jsim, jsbatch, the JSim applet
or any other customized JSim client developed using the JSim source
distribution. jsim and jsbatch both recognize the switch:
<pre>
      -server [username@][scheme]hostname[:port][/servername]
</pre>
</p>
<p>    All the elements in brackets (that is, all except the hostname) are 
optional:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>username</strong> defaults to the user's local login name;</li>
<li><strong>scheme</strong> defaults to "rmi://" which is currently the
only supported protocol. </li>
<li><strong>port</strong> defaults to 1099;</li>
<li><strong>servername</strong> defaults to "JSimServer".</li>

</ul>
<p>    When servers are running using the default port and servername the
syntax reduces to something like:
<pre>
      jsim -server brainiac.mit.edu
</pre>
</p>
<p>    For information on connecting to a server from the JSim applet,
see <a href="Admin_WWW.html">Administering a JSim-enabled Web Site</a> .</p>
<h2>  <a name="firewall">Traversing a Firewall</a></h2>
<p>    A network firewall, sitting between a JSim server and its clients,
induces complications for proper operation.  A connection between client
and server uses 3 separate TCP ports, the main server port (specified via
the -port switch) and two dynamically assigned ports.  By default, the
dynamic ports are randomly assigned via Java RMI mechanisms.  This can be 
problematic because firewalls often limit open ports.  In such
situations, the -userPort switch (above) narrows the range of ports that
must be open.  Note that all ports in the -userPort range must be 
open for guaranteed connection success,  since the client may not specify
which of the available ports will be used.</p>
<p>    As an example, we'll consider a server "secret",  hidden behind a 
firewall "firewall.paranoid.com",  being accessed by a trusted client
"client.org".  The server will allow a maximum of 2
simultaneous clients.  We'll use port 2099 for the main server and start
the dynamic pool at 3010:
<pre>
      jsserver -port 2099 -userPort 3010 -maxClient 2 -start SERVERDIR
</pre>
</p>
<p>    We'll use ssh to forward the needed ports across the firewall.  The 
-userPort pool is of size maxClients+1=3,  so the needed ports are 2099,
3010, 3011 and 3012.  From client.org:
<pre>
      ssh -L 2099:secret:2099 -L 3010:secret:3010 \
        -L 3011:secret:3011 -L 3012:secret:3012 firewall.paranoid.com
</pre>
</p>
<p>    Once the client has established the above connection,  jsim may
then be lauched (in a separate window) via:
<pre>
      jsim -server localhost:2099
</pre>
</p>
<p>    In the absence of ssh forwarding being available on the firewall,
alternative security mechanisms accomplishing the same end should be
discussed with the firewall administrator.  If you have circumstances
that cannot be addressed by JSim's current mechanisms,  please contact
the JSim development team.</p>
