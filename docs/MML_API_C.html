    <h1>The JSim C/C++ Language API</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document describes the JSim C/C++ Application Programmer
Interface (API), the specification for how to write C or C++ code so that
is will successfully interface with MML functions and procedures (F&P).  
This document assumes the reader is familiar with MML F&P and with the C
or C++ programming languages.</p>
<h2>  Details:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Structures & macros used in the C/C++ API are defined in
JSIMHOME/JSIMOS/include/jsimapi.h, where JSIMOS is your operating system
(linux, win32, ...).  </li>
<li>Each argument passed to an MML function or procedure will be
represented by a JSimArg structure.  Each JSimArg will have an associated
JSimGrid structure for each MML domain associated with the argument.  A
JSimArg's realVal array is a double array representing the arguments's
values.  realVal's length in the product of the associated JSimGrid sizes
(or 1, if no grids). Multi-dimensional array ordering (row-major vs.  
row-minor) is not yet finalized for multi-dimensional arguments (pending
Fortran implementation).  At call time, input arguments will have realVal
set to model calculated values, output arguments will have realVal set to
NaNs.</li>
<li>Function values are returned with the JSIM_RETURN macro.  Procedure
output arguments are returned by setting the "realVal" array elements in a
JSimArg.  realVal should never be reallocated. JSIM_RETURN is required for
both functions and procedures to free up local resources.  Omitting
JSIM_RETURN will cause memory leaks.</li>
<li>The JSIM_ERROR macro may be used when error conditions are
encountered to generate run-time Exceptions that will cause the model run
to terminate.</li>
<li>See comments in jsimapi.h for further details. </li>
<li>See <a href="MML_Func_C.html">Calling C from MML</a> for some simple examples.</li>

</ul>
