<h1>Using Delay Lines in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p> This document describes construction of delay lines in JSim MML.  A 
delay line is a mechanism for delaying the delivery of a signal. 
Mathematically, this may be thought of as querying the value of a 
variable v(t) at an earlier time v(t-delay).  While MML does not have an 
explicit "delay()" function currently (one is being planned), delay 
lines may be created in MML using several alternative methods which are 
described below. </p>

<h2>  <a name="func">Variable Function (VF) Delay Lines</a></h2>

<p>This form of delay line uses MML VF syntax, which treats a dynamic 
variable v as a function v(expression).  For a simple delay line, the 
appropriate VF call is v(t-delay) which is described below (those 
interested if the full generality of VFs, should see <a 
href="MML_VarFunc.html">Using Variable Functions in MML</a>).  
Consider the following example:</p>

<?php jsText("examples/MML_Delay/vf1.mod"); ?>

<p>Note that the definition of udelayed uses an "if" clause to prevent 
u() queries for t less than 0.  Such queries would cause a out-of-range 
error when the model is run.</p>

<p>While the above delay implementation is adequate in most 
circumstances, there are some subtleties that can sometimes cause 
problems:</p>

<ol>

<li>JSim calculates u(t-delay) by linearly interpolating u(t) values 
calculated from previous time points, that is, u's values on the defined 
time grid.  This means the accuraccy of u(t-delay) depends upon the 
pseudo-linear behaviour of u.  Normally, specifying an appropriately 
small time step (t.delta) will address this problem.</li>

<li>The above interpolation behaviour means that if delay is 
less than t.delta, then u(t-delay) will return a NaN because the 
interpolated values will include u values not yet calculated.  This 
means you must specify a delay value greater that t.delta to get
acceptable results.  In any case, delay must normally be large compared 
to t.delta in order to achieve acceptable interpolation accuraccy.
</li>

<li>Third, the "if" clause above is, strictly speaking, correct only for 
t.min=0.  If t.min is not necessarily zero in your model,  the correct
"if" clause should be "if (t-t.min &lt delay) ..."</li>

</ol>

<p>The following model incorporates two refinements of the previous 
one's "if" clause.  First, udelayed is set equal to u if the delay is 
too small, allowing the case of the delay=0 to be handled correctly.  
Second, the case of non-zero t.min is handled correctly.</p>
