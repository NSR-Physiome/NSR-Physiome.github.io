<h2><a name="binaries">Introduction</a>: what is needed</h2>

<p>JSim version 2.03 and above require the main libraries and java 
bindings from <A HREF="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a>, 
 the utility program <code>sbtranslate</code> from the <A 
HREF="http://antimony.sf.net/">Antimony</a> package, and <a href="http://stanley-gu.github.com/sbml2matlab/">sbml2matlab</a> program (JSim v2.07 and above) for full functionality.  This document describes how to obtain what you need from 
those packages.</p>

<P>The core JSim program requires libsbml to perform its SBML/MML translations and Matlab code generation.  This means that we need:
<UL>
<LI><code>libsbml</code>, the core C++ library; 
<LI><code>libsbmlj</code>, the SWIG-based wrapper Java-to-C++ library; and 
<LI><code>libsbmlj.jar</code>, the java code that calls the SWIG library. 
</UL>

By default, libsbml distributions will statically link the libsbml 
library and the libsbmlj library (plus any dependent XML-reading 
libraries and compression libraries), so there is only a single library 
file that you need (libsbmlj), plus the jar file.  If space is not an 
issue, it is highly recommended that this be used directly.  However, if 
space is an issue, it is possible to compile the library yourself.</p>

<p>In addition, the Antimony program <code>sbtranslate</code> is used to 
perform the Antimony/MML translation, as well as (potentially) 
Antimony/MML/CellML translations.  This is an external executable that 
also uses libsbml internally, as well as (potentially) the CellML API.  
Antimony binary distributions can also be used in any form, as long as 
'sbtranslate' works.  Again, if space is an issue, you may wish to 
ensure that sbtranslate uses the same version of libsbml that you use 
above.  However, if the binary distribution of libsbml is being used, 
this will not use the libsbml library at all (as it is statically linked 
to libsbmlj instead), so it is not even necessary to ensure that the 
version of libsbml being used is the same!  If space is indeed an issue, 
you'll need to compile from source, and at that point, you might as well 
compile libsbml at the same time.</p>

<h2>  <a name="binaries">Extracting from binaries</a></h2>

<p>Visit the <A HREF="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a> home 
page, and follow the 'Download libSBML' link (which currently (September 
2011) points to the <A 
HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/5.0.0/">5.0.0 
version</a>).  Assuming you are assembling binaries for distribution in 
the 'canonical' JSIMAUXLIB folders, you can get the two files you need 
(the libsbmlj library and the libsbmlj.jar file) from these 
distributions: follow the instructions for installation, and copy any of 
the libsbml.jar files (they should be functionally identical, if not 
actually identical) into $JSIMSRC/third/server/, and 
[libsbmlj.dll|libsbmlj.dylib|libsbmlj.so] into 
$JSIMAUXLIB/[win32|macos|linux]/.</p>

<P>Next, visit the <A HREF="http://antimony.sf.net/">Antimony</a> home 
page, and download any binary installers you find there (there will 
almost certainly be one for Windows, there may be one for MacOSX, and 
there probably will not be one for linux).  Again, follow the 
instructions provided, and find the 'sbtranslate' executable.  Copy this 
and *all* associated libraries into $JSIMAUXLIB.  Assuming the version 
you download works with CellML, this will include several different 
libraries for that (including libxml2), plus the libsbml library, plus 
(on windows) two dll's needed to work with Visual Studio-compiled 
programs.  Assuming you downloaded the binaries for libsbml, the libsbml 
library provided here may be the same or it may be different from the 
other; it won't matter, as libsbmlj is completely self-contained.</p>

<h2> <a name="source">Building from source</a></h2>

<P>Assuming either that space is an issue, or that the above binaries do 
not work or are not provided on your platform, you may need to build 
things from source.  This should actually be fairly straightforward, as 
libSBML, Antimony, and even the CellML API now use CMake as their build 
system. </p>

<p>The first step, then, is to obtain CMake for all platforms on which 
you wish to build from source.  If it is not already available on your 
system, you can get it from <A HREF="http://cmake.org/">cmake.org</a>.  
libSBML requires CMake version 2.8.0 or higher. </p>

<p>Next, get the libsbml source from <A 
HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/</a>.  
As of this writing, the most recent was 5.0.0.  </P>

<p> Unzip the file and cd into that directory.  Now we need to change 
the java bindings from linking to the static version to linking to the 
dynamic version.  Edit 
<code>[libsbml]/src/bindings/java/CMakeLists.txt</code> and search for 
'-static'.  In 5.0.0, this line looked like: 
<pre>
   target_link_libraries(binding_java_lib ${LIBSBML_LIBRARY}-static )
</pre>
Delete the '-static' bit, so it looks like:
<pre>
   target_link_libraries(binding_java_lib ${LIBSBML_LIBRARY} )
</pre>

The deal here is that the name of the static libsbml library is 
'libsbml-static.a' and the name of the dynamic libsbml library is 
'libsbml.so' (or whatever)--deleting '-static' will make it look for the 
dynamic one.  This will save space, but will require that you always 
update both libsbml and sbtranslate at the same time in the future</P>

<p>Next, we need a few programs and libraries: SWIG, and an XML 
parser--I went with 'expat'; other options are 'libxml' and 'xerces'.  
As of this writing, a bug in the CellML API makes using CellML and 
libsbml-with-libxml together impossible, so if a goal is to use 
sbtranslate's CellML translation capabilities, you should use expat or 
xerces. </p>

<p>SWIG came pre-installed on most systems on which I tested, but 
version 1.3.31 (which came on baggins) had a bug in it that prevented 
compiling ('buffer overflow error'); the more recent 2.0.3 worked fine 
for me.  I compiled it from source; the only warning here is that it 
will also need something called 'pcre', available from <A 
HREF="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/">ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/</a>.  
'Configure' in the SWIG directory gave me easy-to-follow directions; I 
downloaded PCRE into the SWIG working directory, then ran, from that 
directory, Tools/pcre-build.sh and this configured and compiled pcre.  
Then I ran 'configure', 'make', and 'make install' from that same 
directory to get SWIG up and running, with <pre>configure 
--prefix=/User/lpsmith/swig/</pre> so it would compile into where I 
wanted it. </p>

<p>One word of caution here: If you want to be able to use a single 
libsbml.jar file, you will need the <b>same</b> version of SWIG 
everywhere you build.  Otherwise, the bindings can end up being 
different from one another.  So I would recommend going with 2.0.3 (or 
whatever the latest is) on all three systems. </p>

<p>expat and libxml came preinstalled on baggins; the only issue is that 
it's a dynamic library so you'd have to bundle it up with everything 
else.  If you wanted to compile it static and link that into libsbml 
instead, you'd have one less file to deal with in distributing. </p>

<h3> <a name="libsbml">Building libsbml</a></h3>

<p>So!  Assuming you have all that, we're ready to compile.  We're going 
to run cmake--if you're in a console window you'll want to run 
'<code>ccmake</code>' (cmake for consoles); if you're actually at the 
computer in question, you can run '<code>cmake-gui</code>' which is 
prettier and has a slightly better UI. </p>

<p>In any event, cd into the libsbml directory (libsbml-5.0.0/, *not* 
libsbml-5.0.0/src/), then create a new directory in which to build; I 
usually use the creative name 'build':
<pre>
cd libsbml-5.0.0/; mkdir build; cd build
</pre>
Then from that working directory, run ccmake or cmake-gui with the 
argument '..' for 'up one directory':
<pre>
cmake-gui ..
</pre>
(you're pointing at the root 'CMakeLists.txt' file)
</p>

<p>Now hit the 'configure' button (cmake-gui) or 'c' (ccmake) and it'll 
churn a bit and make you a list of options.  If you're on Windows, it'll 
ask which type of build system you want to use--I tend to use Visual 
Studio for my projects, but cygwin is also available, if you have that 
installed.  For me, using ccmake on baggins, I see:

</pre>
with instructions on how to change these at the bottom.  In the GUI, all 
the 'ON/OFF' options are check marks.  We do indeed want to change some 
of the options here: from the top: </p>

<p>The first thing you probably should do is change the compiler from 
'c++' to 'g++', since that's more likely to be what was used for other 
projects.  So switch to the 'advanced view'--this is a button in the 
GUI, and the 't' button (for 'toggle') in ccmake.  Find 
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER and switch it to g++ (probably /usr/bin/g++) and hit 
'compile' again.  (When you change the compiler, all the other options 
get reset, so we have to do this first).</p>

<p>Next, if you're on a 64-bit system, you'll need to compile to a 
32-bit architecture to be compatible with the rest of JSim.  To do this, 
you'll again need to be in the 'advanced view'.  Find 'CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS' 
and add '-m32', and find 'CMAKE_C_FLAGS' and add '-m32' there, too.  
(Note: if you compiled libexpat yourself, you'll need to do the same 
thing there.  I edited the Makefile after running 'configure' and just 
added '-m32' to all the various CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.)  After changing 
these options, my ccmake screen here looks like:
<pre>
 CMAKE_AR                         /usr/bin/ar                                  
 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 Release                                      
 CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE             ON                                           
 CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER               /usr/bin/g++                                 
 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS                  -m32                                         
 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG            -g

 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE          -O3 -DNDEBUG                                 
 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO   -O2 -g                                       
 CMAKE_C_COMPILER                 /usr/bin/gcc                                 
 CMAKE_C_FLAGS                    -m32                                         
 CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG              -g                                           
 CMAKE_C_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL         -Os -DNDEBUG                                 
 CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE            -O3 -DNDEBUG                                 
 CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO     -O2 -g                                       
</pre>
After you've done this, toggle back to the regular view.
</p>

<p>Next, set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to where you want libsbml installed.  
I tend to use '../install', which will build it in [libsbml]/install/ 
</p>

<p>If your installed version of SWIG is old, you'll need to change 
'SWIG_EXECUTABLE' to the version you compiled.  For me, this was 
/Users/lpsmith/swig/bin/swig </p>

<p>Since space is an issue, we're going to turn off the automatic 
reading of .zip and .bz files: turn off both WITH_BZIP2 and WITH_ZLIB. 
</p>

<p>If you're compiling on a mac and want universal binaries (which you 
probably do), set ENABLE_UNIVERSAL to ON. </p>

<p>To get the java bindings, turn on WITH_JAVA.  (note: 'WITH_SWIG' is 
required if you want Java; it's on by default and you can and should 
leave it on.) </p>

<p>There are three options for using a particular xml library: 
WITH_LIBXML, WITH_EXPAT, and WITH_XERCES.  Exactly one of these should 
be turned on, and the other two should be turned off.  By default, 
WITH_LIBXML is on, but CellML also uses libxml in a way that's 
incompatible with libsbml's use of it, so if you want CellML 
translation, turn that off, and turn on either expat or xerces.  For me, 
this was 'WITH_EXPAT'. </p>

<p>Now hit the Configure button (or 'c') again.  This will pop up new 
options if you changed the xml parsing library, namely, the directory 
where it found it.  For me when compiling on linux, it found expat 
installed, but I went ahead and changed it to a version I compiled 
myself:
<pre>
 LIBEXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR             /user3/lpsmith/expat/include                 
 LIBEXPAT_LIBRARY                 /user3/lpsmith/expat/lib/libexpat.so         
</pre>
It will also find SWIG_DIR and SWIG_VERSION based on the version of 
SWIG_EXECUTABLE you set. </p>

<p>f you're on a mac, you'll also want to change 
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES.  JSim doesn't handle 64-bit yet, and jbb is 
moving away from his ppc, so for now we only need the i386: delete the 
amd64 and ppc option and just leave 'i386'.  This kind of defeats the 
purpose of the 'ENABLE_UNIVERSAL' option, but I'd use it anyway as it's 
more explicit--if you don't, you might end up with a 64-bit version. 
</p>

<p>Hit 'configure' again, and if there are no further issues, you will 
now be able to hit 'g'/the 'Generate' button.  If no such option 
appears, try hitting 'configure' again and looking for unset variables 
you think sound important.  My final version on a mac looked like:
<pre>
 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 Release

Note that it doesn't matter that LIBBZ_LIBRARY etc. are set: since 
'WITH_BZIP2' is off, it won't use it.  If you didn't have it on your 
system and it's set to something like NOTFOUND this is OK. </p>

<p>After you've generated output, you'll then have Makefiles in your 
build/ directory.  If you configured it for Visual Studio, you can load 
it up there; otherwise, you'll probably want to type 'make' now.  If you 
want to see what's going on, type:
<pre>
   make VERBOSE=true
</pre>
If you leave off the VERBOSE bit, it'll still work, just be more 
mysterious. </p>

<p>Finally, install!
<pre>
   make install
</pre>   
and it'll put it in ../install or wherever you pointed it!
</p>

<p>For Windows/visual studio, the above instructions can still be 
followed.  The only thing to keep in mind is that once you are in VS, 
you'll need to change the project to 'Release' yourself, since by 
default it'll always come up 'Debug'.  Hitting 'build' will build 
everything, and building the INSTALL target will install it. </p>

<p>The files we will actually need in JSim are three:
<pre>
[install]/share/libsbml/bindings/java/libsbmlj.jar
[install]/share/libsbml/bindings/java/libsbmlj.dylib (or .so or .dll)
[install]/lib/libsbml.dylib (or .so or .dll)
</pre>
Note that on a Mac, the 5.0.0 CMake build would create 
bindings/java/libsbmlj.dylib, but this was changed in svn (so presumably 
for all future versions of the library) to create 
bindings/java/libsbmlj.jnilib It is the exact same file, and it is fine 
if you rename one to the other. </p>

<p>The .jar file goes in <code>[JSim]/third/server/</code>
</p>

<p>And the other two go in <code>[jsimauxlib]/[system]/</code>
</p>

<p>You'll need to re-run jsbuild.j to get the new .jar file (I think) 
and after that, you're good to go! </p>

<p><b>MacOS application issues:</b>  For libsbml to work properly
in the MacOS double-click application,  the reference to
libsbml*.dylib in libsbmlj.jnilib must be changed. This is
accomplished via $JSIMSRC/build/jsset_libsbmlj.  This does not 
affect command-line launch of JSim on MacOS,  only double-click
launch.  jssetup_libsbmlj requires you environment be set
properly for a <a href="Devel_Build.html">JSim source build</a>.</p>

<pre>
# first set you enviromnent for a JSim source build (JSIMSRC, etc)
# then issue the following command in the MacOS libsbml build directory

jssetup_libsbmlj libsbmlj.jnilib

# pay attention to any error messages 
</pre>


<h3>  <a name="antimony">Building sbtranslate (Antimony)</a></h3>

<p>Instructions for building sbtranslate are available on Antimony's 
website: <A 
HREF="http://antimony.sourceforge.net/antimony-installation.html">http://antimony.sourceforge.net/antimony-installation.html</a>.  
You should already have everything you need from building libsbml, with 
the exception of the <A 
HREF="http://www.cellml.org/tools/downloads/cellml_api/releases/1.10">CellML 
SDK</a>.  I'm not going to try to tell you how to build CellML here, 
because that's too complicated.  My advice is to try downloading the SDK 
for your platform, and if it works, great, and if not, turn off 
Antimony's ability to translate CellML (by turning off 'WITH_CELLML' in 
CMake).  If I recall correctly, the current version of JSim doesn't even 
attempt to use sbtranslate to translate CellML anyway. </p>

<p>A few other things of note:
<ul>
<LI>Point LIBSBML_INCLUDE_DIR to wherever you installed libsbml/include/
<LI>Point LIBSBML_LIBRARY to wherever you installed libsbml/lib/libsbml.[whatever]
<LI>Point CELLML_API_INSTALL_DIR to wherever you copied the CellML SDK.
<LI>You don't need WITH_COMP_SBML, WITH_QTANTIMONY, WITH_SBW, or WITH_SBW_TRANSLATOR:  turn all of these off.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once you build sbtranslate, you'll need to put that plus all its 
dependencies into <code>[jsimauxlib]/[system]/</code>.  The dependencies 
are:
<ul>
<li>sbtranslate
<LI>libantimony
<LI>libsbml (which should already be there)
<li>If you have included CellML:
<ul>
<li>libannotools</li>
<li>libceleds</li>
<li>libcellml</li>
<li>libcevas</li>
<li>libcuses</li>
<li>libmalaes</li>
<li>libtelicems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac users:</strong> You may have to update the following script (sbtranslate.sh):
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# wrapper for sbtranslate
#  needed since forked process from JSim does not autoset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

DIR=`echo $0 | sed s/sbtranslate.sh//`

cd $DIR

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR

./sbtranslate $*
</pre>
 due to name changes, etc. This script is necessary when users start JSim using the point and click method (as opposed to command line start-up) so that when JSim calls sbtranslate it can find the dependent libraries (libsbml.dylib libantimony.dylib).

<h3> <a name="sbmltomatlab">Building SBML to Matlab code generator (sbml2matlab)</a></h3>
<p>sbml2matlab is a translator program that converts an SBML model into a MATLAB function and it is used by JSim to convert JSim MML models(converted to SBML) into Matlab code. See <a href="http://stanley-gu.github.com/sbml2matlab/">sbml2matlab web site</a> for up-to-date, detailed, build instructions. The sbml2matlab executable is dependent on the libSBML library.
<br /><br />
Dependencies:
<ul>
<li>libsbml - library of SBML APIs, built above.</li>
<li>cmake - used to generate platform specific 'make' files and/or MS Visual Studio solution.</li>
</ul>
First download source code from <a href="http://stanley-gu.github.com/sbml2matlab/">sbml2matlab web site</a>. Next, generate platform specific build instructions for sbml2matlab by creating a build directory and cd into it:
<pre>
cd dir_where_sbml2matlab_code_is; mkdir build; cd build
</pre>
Now run cmake ('ccmake ..' or 'cmake-gui') and fill out necessary information to generate build scripts for the particular platform. Below is an example from the MacOS:

<strong>The important parts are: compiler flags (-m32) and the locations of libsbml and sbml header files</strong>. When happy with the information hit 'configure' again, and if there are no further issues, you will 
now be able to hit 'g', the 'Generate' button to generate build information targeting the particular OS. Exit cmake.
Now that the build files have been created then either type 'make' in the build directory or open up the MS visual studio .sln file with Visual Studio Express and build all (If building for MS Windows). Two files are generated which need to be copied over to jsimauxlib:
<ul>
<li>libNOM.so (NOM.dll)</li>
<li>sbml2matlab(.exe) </li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac users:</strong> You may have to update the following script (sbml2matlab.sh):
