<h1>Events in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p> MML events model discrete changes of physical and physiological state such as 
voltage transitions, heart beats, etc.  Events also provide a mechanism for 
calculation of recursive functions, such as Fibonacci numbers.  Event-driven 
variables can freely intermix with continuous (e.g. ODE-calculated) variables, 
allowing you to model hybrid discrete/continuous systems.</p>

<h2>  <a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>An MML event consists of a realDomain t (which usually represents time), a 
boolean trigger expression which is a function of t and a series of action 
assignments.  The trigger is tested for each value of t, and the event is fired 
if the value of the trigger evaluates to true.  When the event fires, the action 
assignments are executed in the order specified.</p>

<p>Action assignments are of the form "v = expression;" where v is a realState, 
intState or ODE variable.  A realState and intState variable v(t) must be 
assigned an initial value when t=t.min and subsequent values of v(t) are 
calculate by carrying the value from the previous time step forward, and then 
altering it based upon any triggered events.  An ODE variable is assigned an 
initial value when t=t.min and subsequent values are calculated via an ODE
starting with the previous t value.  Once the ODE calculation is complete,
v(t) is altered based upon any triggered events.</p>

<h2>  <a name="state">State variables and a simple example</a></h2>

<p>Here is a simple example that counts the number of times an 
externally provided voltage V exceeds a threshold voltage V0:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/count.proj"); ?>

<p> The state variable ct(t) is initialized to 0 at time zero, and is incremented 
each time the event (V>V0) is triggered.  The event contains a single event 
action "ct=ct+1". The statement "ct=ct+1" would be nonsense as 
an MML equation,  but is acceptable as an event action.</p>

<h2>  <a name="gate1">Gate Example 1</a></h2>

<p>The following model describes a gate that opens when an external 
voltage exceeds threshold V1,  and closes when it drops below 
threshold V0:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/gate1.proj"); ?>

<p>By using two events, we have introduced memory into the system.  The
value of "open" for V between V0 and V1 is dependent not upon the current
value of V, but upon previous values.</p>

<h2>  <a name="gate2">Gate example 2</a></h2>

<p>The event triggers in gate example 1 are slightly redundant.  The gate opening 
trigger "V>V1" would have the same effect as the one given "open=0 and V>V1".  
However, by using the longer form, we can ensure that the events "gate opening" 
and "gate closing" happen alternately, which is useful in the following model. A 
running count is kept of the number of gate openings is kept in variable ct.  The 
time of the latest gate closure is kept in variable tlast. Multiple actions may 
be associated with a single event by enclosing them in curly braces.  </p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/gate2.proj"); ?>


<h2>  <a name="gate3">Gate example 3</a></h2>

<p>    Event-driven variables become more useful for modeling when their 
values drive the calculation of other system variables which, in turn,
trigger events.  In the following example, V either grows or shrinks 
exponentially based up whether the gate is open.  Whether the gate is
open depends upon current and previous values of V:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/gate3.proj"); ?>

<h2><a name="ode">Events using ODE variables</a></h2>

<p>Events may act upon ODE variables (this is a new feature for JSim version 2).
In the example below,  the u decays exponentially starting a u(t.min)=1.  When
u fall below .2,  an event resets it back to 1,  resulting in a periodic wave 
form:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/event_ode.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="recursive">Recursive functions</a></h2>

<p>    JSim events support calculation of recursive functions which are
not supported elsewhere in MML.  The following example calculates 
the Fibonacci numbers:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Events/fibonacci.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="caution">Some cautions</a></h2>

<p>Event triggers are
tested once per time step.  At any given time-step, zero, one or more than
one events may be triggered.  If multiple events are triggered at a
time-step, the order in which they are triggered is undefined.  However,
the actions within an event always take place in the declared order when
that event is triggered.  It is up to the MML author to write their events
and triggers in such a way so that the result is well defined.</p>

<p>    Here's a simplified version of a problem that can easily occur.  If
the triggers in gated example 2:</p>

<pre>
event (open=0 and V&gt;V1) {
  open = 1;
  ct = ct+1;
}
</pre>

<p>had been written as:</p>

<pre>
event (open=0 and V&gt;V1) open = 1;
event (open=0 and V&gt;V1) ct = ct+1;
</pre>

<p>then the value of ct would be unpredictable.  If the first event
trigger were tested first, the second event would never be triggered so ct
would remain perpetually at 0.  If the second event trigger were tested
first, ct would be calculated as in the original example.</p>
