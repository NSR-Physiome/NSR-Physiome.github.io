<h1>JSim Multiprocessing Development</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<p>  This page is a working document for JSim internals developers working
on JSim multi-processing (MP) support:</p>

</ul>

<p>  <a name="over">Overview</a></p>

<p>  The first stage of JSim MP support will use Java threads. The user will
request some number of separate run threads (probably as a command-line
switch).  On a machine with multiple processors, the JVM will balance the
threads between available processors, increasing performance. On single
processor machines, multiple threads will compete for time slots, so
performance will actually be somewhat reduced, but will allow for testing
during development.</p>

<h2>  <a name="upgrade">Native Library Upgrades</a></h2>

<p>    The native code for ODE, PDE and optimizer methods will need to be
upgraded to support MP.  The native code may be found in
$JSIMSRC/JSim/nonJava.  Each method has original code in C or Fortran
(e.g. radau.f) and a JNI wrapper (e.g. jradau.c).  I've already modified
all the JNI wrappers to support MP.  There are separate data structures
allocated for each thread (e.g. jsodethread.h and .c) indexed by integer
threadInx.  This threadInx must be passed to and returned by the native 
solver code.</p>

<p>    Upgrades to each method should be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> threadInx becomes the 1st argument for each top-level solver
function call that results in an external callback (e.g. fcn() in ODE
solvers).  threadInx also becomes the 1st argument in the callback. This
will allow the JNI wrapper to redirect simultaneous callbacks to the
correct Java code.  threadInx need not be (and therefore, should not be)
passed to functions that do not perform external callbacks.</li>
<li> All solver code should be made reentrant, if at all possible.  
This should be straight-forward for most solvers that do everything from a
single entry point (i.e. a single solver call from within the JNI
wrapper).  CVode may be a special case (see below).</li>
<li> Test programs should be written in C or Fortran (as appropriate)
that tests reentrancy by calling the solver recursively to 2 levels.
For example,  an optimizer that calls a second optimizer within its
fcn() call.  While not exhaustive,  such tests are easy to debug,  and
catch many common errors.  </li>
<li> Once the above is completed, send me a copy for review.  Once I
have acceptable versions of code and test programs for all the solvers,
I'll roll them into the JSim code base, along with appropriate changes to
the JNI wrappers.</li>
</ol>

<h2>  Reentrancy Guidelines for C modules</h2>

<p>    Wikipedia.org is a good source for recent computer info.  See entries
there reentrant, thread-safe, etc.  Checking with the original code
authors is probably a good idea.</p>

<p>    Use no static variables or variables declared outside of functions
unless they are constant for all threads. All called functions must be
reentrant.</p>

<p>    Send me other guidelines you think should be here.</p>

<h2>  Reentrancy guidelines for Fortran modules</h2>

<p>    Ditto comments above regarding Wikipedia.</p>

<ul>
<li>everything appearing in a SAVE statement;</li>
<li>variables in COMMON blocks;</li>
<li>arrays that use more than 32kb storage.</li>

</ul>
<p>    However, arrays that are dimensioned by a dummy or COMMON variable or
assumed-size arrays are put in the stack. g77 does not complain about
recursive calling.</p>
<p>    Send me other guidelines you think should be here.</p>
<h2>  <a name="bench">Benchmarks</a></h2>
<p>    MP Performance on 4 Tested Platforms:
<pre>
        Multi-run Benchmark Results  (larger number indicates better performance)
        #processors     altix1  bigbox  baggins gollum
        1               100     100     100     100

        8               479

        Single Run Benchmark Results (larger number indicates better performance)       
        #processors     altix1  bigbox  baggins gollum
        1               100     100     100     100

<p>    Notes for above:</p>

<ul>

<li>Multi-run benchmark was a 16-run "loops" analysis using VS001 
model using release 1.6.66.</li>

<li>Single run benchmark was a 32 parallel path ODE model using a
prototype version of JSim 1.6.68.  The model's java code was manually
edited in a manner consistent with proposed changes to the JSim MML
compiler.</li>

<li>Revised altix performance figures available 6 Dec 2006.</li>

<li>Performance figures are percentages based on 100% for a single
processor usage on the system in question.  Single processor performance
on the tested systems varied by up to a factor of 3 due to hardware and OS
differences.</li>

<li>"altix1" is a 128 processor SGI Altix system running JSim for Linux
IA64, however our altix1 account is restricted to a maximum 16 processors
for a single job. "bigbox" is a 4 processor Intel system running JSim for
Linux AMD64.  "baggins" is an Intel-based Mac Mini.  "gollum" is a
G5-based Power Mac.</li>

</ul>
