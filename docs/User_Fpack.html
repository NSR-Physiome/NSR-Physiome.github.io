    <h1>The JSim Fortran Package</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<p>  This document gives overall information about the JSim Fortran package
(fpack), a set of classic XSim Fortran models ported to run under JSim.

<h2>  <a name="avail">Available models</a></h2>
<p>    The following models are currently available:</p>

<ul>
<li>body: a whole-body recirculation model with multiple organs;</li>
<li>btex20: a two-region, distributed blood-tissue exchange model;</li>
<li>btex40: a four-region, distributed blood-tissue exchange model;</li>
<li>demo: a demonstration model showing decaying sine, cosine, and
tangent functions;</li>
<li>gentex: a multi-path, multi-species, five region organ model with
nonlinear transmembrane transport, nonlinear reactions and time-varying
blood flow and volume;</li>
<li>gentex2: a version of the gentex model with restricted capability
for users who do not require the full capability of gentex.</li>
<li>mhed: a carbon11--meta-hydroxyephedrine transport model (based on
gentex);</li>
<li>mmid4: a multi-path, multi-indicator, four-region organ model;</li>
<li>msid4:  a multi-path, multi-indicator, multi-species, four-region
organ model.</li>

</ul>
<h2>  <a name="use">Using the fpack models</a></h2>
<p>    Example project files for the fpack models may be found in the
doc/examples/fpack directory of your JSim distribution.  The models are
stored in project files (rather than simple .mod files) because they
contain run-time layout customizations (RTML) as well as MML model code.  
Copy an example project file to your working directory and work there.  
Alternatively, you may incorporate an example model into an existing
project by opening it in a separate project window and using the "Project"
tab copy/paste mechanisms. Do not do your work inside the distributed
example files or your work will be lost next time you upgrade JSim.</p>
<p>    <strong>Important: be sure to read the caveats below before trying them
out</strong>.</p>
<h2>  <a name="caveat">Some caveats</a></h2>
<p>    Fpack is currently available only under Linux and MacOS.  Fpack
for Windows is still in development.  All of
the models except btex20, btex40 and demo currently require GLIBC_2.3.  
</p>

<p> Customized graphic front-ends for the fpack models are are still a 
bit rough. They were created via an automated conversion program from 
the original XSim .cf files, and will require some hand-tuning to look 
just right.  This hand-tuning will be done as time allows.  </p>
