    <h1>Using BCLs in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document is an introduction to Biological Component Librarys 
(BCLs),  and their use in constructing JSim models.  </p>
<h2>  Overview</h2>
<p>    JSim's Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) is a human-readable
language for describing a model in mathematical terms.  MML supports the
definition of high-level Biological Component Libraries (BCLs) that
describe a model in terms of physical or physiological entities (e.g.
compartments, membranes, chemical species ...).  When a BCL-based model
runs, the high-level, hierarchical components are translated into a flat
namespace MML representation, a process called "flattening".  This MML
representation is then translated by JSim's Planner into procedural code
which is controlled within the JSim user environment for numerical
calculation and analysis.</p>
<p>    BCLs allow complex models to be assembled more quickly and accurately
and lower the barrier of entry to modeling by removing the requirement
that modelers derive the mathematical state equations for a system.
Because BCLs incorporate domain specific knowledge, they are more compact
than MML.  Because BCLs share the representation mechanisms of MML,
modelers can intermix low-level MML constructs when the required 
functionality is not present in the BCL per se.</p>
<h2>  Available BCLs</h2>
<p>    NSR currently distributes one BCL with JSim, the Metabolite Flow and
Exchange (MFAX) BCL.  MFAX contains a set of components appropriate for
chemical network models in multiple compartments with convective flow and
membrane transport between those compartments:</p>

<li><a href="MML_MFAX_Ref.html">The MFAX BCL Reference Manual</a></li>

</ul>
<p>    The BTex BCL,  which was supported under earlier JSim versions, has 
been revised and supplanted by the MFAX BCL,  which contains a super-set
of BTex BCL functionality.  The BTex BCL is no longer supported.</p>
<p>    Creating a BCL is a fairly technical process, and should be undertaken
by experienced Java programmers.  If you are interested in this, contact
the NSR for more information.</p>
