<h1>Using JSim with the Systems Biology Workbench (SBW)</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://sbw.sourceforge.net/">SBW</a> is a software framework 
for passing systems biology models and data between various software 
applications. Of special interest here is the ability of SBW to pass 
SBML models created in various application (e.g. Copasi, CellDesigner, 
QTAntimony) directly into JSim. The converse ability to pass JSim models 
to other applications via SBW, along with other JSim/SBW functionality, 
is under development, but not yet available.</p>

<h2><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p>Here's an overview of how things work.  The user loads or develops a 
model in some source application (e.g. Copasi).  The user then directs 
the source application (typically via an SBW menu) to send an SBML 
version of its model to JSim, or some other application.  The source 
application generates SBML code, passes that code to the SBW broker (a 
process running in the background), which passes the code onto JSim 
(starting a new JSim process, if necessary).  JSim reads the SBML code 
and translates it into MML.  The user can then use JSim to run and 
explore the model.</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="http://sbw.sourceforge.net/installer.html">Install SBW</a> 
on your computer (Windows, MacIntosh and Linux are supported).</li>

<li>Start the SBW broker. The broker runs in the background passing
messages between SBW-enabled applications.  Only one instance can be
running for a given user on a given computer.</li>

<li>Register JSim with the broker.  This may be done via the Project tab 
SBW menu, or by typing <pre>jsim -sbwregister</pre> at the command 
prompt. Registration information is stored in the .sbw sub-directory of 
your user home directory, and normally needs to be done only once.  (You 
should also reregister whenever you install a new version of JSim.)

<li>Download and install JSim and one or more of the <a 
href="#apps">tested source applications below</a> and register these with 
the broker.  Follow instruction as provided by each application's 
documentation.  Often this can be done by typing the command
<pre>ApplicationName -sbwregister</li>

<li>Start one of the tested source applications, and create or load a 
model into it.  Use the application's SBW menu to send the model to JSim.  
After a moment or two, a JSim project window should appear containing the 
model code.  For hints on operating the various applications, see 
the section below.</li>

<h2><a name="module">Connecting SBW to a running JSim application</a></h2>

<p>In some circumstances you may desire to connect a running JSim 
application to SBW, rather than to have SBW launch it.  For example, you 
may have a complex existing project file you want to augment with an 
SBW-provided model.  A JSim application that listens to the SBW broker is 
called an SBW module.  When the broker launches JSim, it automatically 
becomes an SBW module.  If you launch JSim yourself, you may make it an 
SBW module either by selecting "Enable module" from the project tab SBW 
menu, or by including the following switch when starting JSim from the 
command line: <pre>-sbwmodule</pre> </p>

<h2><a name="target">Understanding JSim's SBW target model</a></h2>

<p>A running JSim application may consist of several project windows, 
each of which may contain one or more model tabs.  SBW has no concept of 
projects or multiple models, so it is up to the JSim user to control 
which project and model tab an SBW-transmitted model will be placed.  
This model tab is called the SBW target model.  When the SBW broker 
starts a JSim application, a single project is created containing a 
single model tab.  This tab is designated the SBW target model, and will 
remain so until it is deleted, or the user selects another model tab as 
the SBW target (via the SBW menu's "Set target model..." item). When you 
launch JSim separate from the broker (and enable SBW module 
functionality <a href="#module">as described above</a>) the SBW target 
is initially not set, but may be set by the user.  If JSim receives a 
model from SBW when the SBW target is not set, JSim creates a new model 
tab, and designates it as the SBW target.</p>

<h2><a name="limits">Limitations</a></h2>

<p>JSim currently can process only SBML code that can be translated to 
SBML level 2 version 1.  For example, QTAntimony models sometimes 
generate initialAssignment tags, which are incompatible with level 2 
version 1.  JSim support for more recent SBML versions is under 
development, but not yet available.</p>

<p>Several other roles that JSim might play in the SBW world are being
considered for the future, but are not yet implemented.  These abilities
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ability to send JSim models to other SBW modules;</li>
<li>the ability to provide simulation services for other SBW 
modules;</li>
<li>the ability to provide data analysis and graphing abilities for other 
SBW modules.</li>
</ul>
