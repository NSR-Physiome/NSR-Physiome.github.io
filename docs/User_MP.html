<h1>Using JSim Multiprocessing</h1>


<p>  This page talks about JSim multiprocessing (MP), the ability for a
single JSim session to take advantage of multiple computer processors to
increase calculation speed.</p>

<h3>  <a name="current">Current JSim MP Support</a></h3>

<p>    Most (but not all) JSim models support MP. JSim models support MP
unless they contain the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Non-reentrant <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">functions and 
procedures</a> : this restriction applies to all <a 
href="User_Fpack.html">Fpack</a> (legacy XSIM) models.</li>

</ul>

<p> JSim MP support is currently limited to multirun analyses (loops,
sensitivity analysis, optimization, Monte Carlo, functional imaging) on shared memory
multi-processors. JSim multi-run analyses take advantage of MP by running
up to N model runs in parallel, assuming N system processors are
available.  Benchmark tests indicate near 100% processor utilization up to
4 system processors, with progressively more modest gains for additional
processors.  The actual speed gain you realize will depend upon the
specifics of your computer hardware and operating system.  On a system of
N processors, ideal speed gains would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="User_Loops.html">loops</a> : all requested runs (M in number) are
dispatched at once, realizing a speedup factor of N when N divides evenly 
into M.</li>
<li><a href="User_Sens.html">sensitivity analysis</a> : the first (unperturbed) run
utilizes only one processor.  All subsequenct perturbed runs (P in 
number) are dispatched at once,  realizing a speedup factor of N when N 
divides
evenly into P.  No speedup is realized when only a single perturbed run
is requested (but see <a href="#future">future plans</a> ).</li>
<li><a href="User_Optim.html">optimization</a> : speed gain depends upon the algorthm
selected. Speed gains are realized only when using the MP-capable
algorithms ( see <a href="Solver_Optim_Ref.html">JSim Optimization Algorithms</a> for
current details, but also see <a href="#future">future plans</a> ).  Users should note
that optimization MP requires more memory than single-processor
optimization because storage must be allocated for multiple parallel runs.</li>
<li><a href="User_Monte.html">Monte Carlo analysis</a> : noisy 
optimizations (M in number) are dispatched to all N processors.  Since
M is typically much larger than N,  this results in a speedup factor of 
N.</li>
<li><a href="User_Fim.html">functional imaging</a> : segment 
optimizations (M in number) are dispatched to all N processors.  Since
M is typically much larger than N,  this results in a speedup factor of 
N.</li>

</ul>

<h3>  <a name="active">Activating JSim MP</a></h3>

<p>    JSim MP support may be activated via the -mp command line switch (in
jsim, jsfim or jsbatch), or via Preferences menu in the JSim GUI.</p>

<p>    JSim MP operates by creating parallel computational threads (when
possible) which Java distributes evenly over available system processors (N in
number). The maximum useful number of parallel threads is N. Using more is
counter-productive because the threads will compete with each other for
resources.  Users configure JSim MP by specifying the maximum number of parallel
computate threads to be used. JSim enforces that this number is between 1 and N
(inclusive).</p>

<p>    The following example activates JSim using a maximum of 4 compute
threads.  If the system running the command does not have that many
processors, then the number of processors actually present is used.  This
means you can't hurt yourself by specifying too many processors:
<pre>
      jsim -mp 4 [other arguments]
</pre>
</p>

<p>    In the JSim GUI, MP is activated/deactivated via the "Multiprocessing
configuration..." item in the Preferences menu of the Project tab.  This
configuration box is not available for single-processors systems or for sessions
using a remote server (such as JSim applets).  Note that this JSim Preference is
not currently preserved between sessions, due to the experimental nature of JSim
MP.  Once MP is considered stable, this Preference will be preserved between
sessions.</p> 

<p>    Regardless of activation method above, MP is actually used only on models
that support it (no PDEs or non-reentrant F&P, see above).  JSim recognizes
MP-unsupported models automatically. Therefore, you do not normally need to
worry about toggling MP on and off during a session depending on the model
(however, see exceptions below).  To determine whether a JSim model supports MP,
select "View plan text" in the model's Debug tab or specify -oplan in jsbatch. A
boolean attribute labeled "Allow MP Runs:" gives this information.</p> 

<p>    There are two reasons you might choose to deactivate MP  once it has been
activated:</p>

<ol>

<li> MP is still somewhat experimental.  If you encounter unstable behavior
under MP, you should report the bug to NSR and run deactivate MP until the
problem is resolved.</li>

<li> MP optimization requires more memory than single-processor optimization
because storage must be allocated for parallel model runs. If you are running a
large model, this may potentially exhaust system memory.   Alternatives are to
<a href="User_Memory.html">increase JSim's memory allocation</a> or deactivate
MP during the optimization.</li>

</ol>

<h3>  <a name="future">Future JSim MP Support</a></h3>

<h4>    Non-reentrant F&P</h4>
<p>      JSim allows embedded procedural code, however this code must be
reentrant in order to work properly on multiple processors.  This
restriction is not expected to be lifted, except possibly in the case of
future cluster support (see below).  Model writers interested in writing
reentrant F&P should consult <a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">this document</a> .</p>

<h4>    Fpack (legacy XSIM) models</h4>
<p>      Fpack models rely on procedural code in Fortran common blocks,  and 
are not-reentrant.  See comments above regarding non-reentrant F&P.</p>

<h4>    Sensitivity analysis</h4>
<p>      Currently, the unperturbed run in a sensitivity analysis must
complete before additional perturbed runs are done in parallel.  In the
future, this situation will be improved so that all runs (perturbed and
unperturbed) are done in parallel.</p>

<h4>    Optimization algorithms</h4>
<p>      The Simplex and GGopt optimization algorithms do not support 
MP.  However, JSim's other optimization algorithms do.
</p>

<h4>    Single run MP</h4>
<p>      In future JSim versions, the calculations in a single model run may
be parallelizable, allowing multiple processors to be utilized.  Whether a
single model can utilize MP for effective speedup depends upon the nature
of the equations.  Some possible candidates for parallelization are:</p>

<ol>
<li> Models that use parallel pathways,  for example a blood tissue 
exchange model with multiple parallel arterioles in which each arteriole
is calculated independently.</li>
<li> Models that use parallel PDE solver algorithms.  Currently, JSim
does not provide any such algorithms, but they exist and may be
incorporated into future versions of JSim.</li>
<li> Large ODE models may be seperable into fast and slow interaction
blocks (for example, two organs separated by a blood flow).  It is
possible such blocks could be recognized by the JSim compiler and made to
calculate in parallel.  This is a difficult problem, however, and so
should be viewed as a future goal.</li>

</ol>

<h4>    Distributed-memory computation (clusters)</h4>

<p> A compute cluster is a set of networked computers running common 
software for a particular task.  Cluster nodes do not share a common 
memory, so message passing protocols between nodes must be implemented 
to coordinate computations on common models and datasets.  Such message 
passing induces overhead, meaning clusters are inherently less efficient 
at closely coupled parallel computation than shared memory systems.  
However, clusters can be very efficient and economical for loosely 
coupled parallel computation because an N-node cluster is usually 
cheaper than an N-processor shared memory system (for large N).</p>

<p> JSim cluster support is under consideration. The most likely 
scenario is that <a href="Admin_Server.html">jsserver</a> will updated 
to allow separate model runs to be farmed out to available cluster nodes 
automatically.  Prospects for multi-run MP analyses (loops, sensitivity 
analysis, optimization) on clusters are very good, since such 
computations are loosely coupled.  Single-run MP speedup via clusters is 
more problematic because the parallel threads are more closely coupled.  
While single-run cluster MP is possible, it must be considered a long 
term objective at this point.</p>

<p> It is possible that future JSim cluster support would allow MP 
support for models containing non-reentrant F&P, such as Fpack models. 
More information will be available on this topic once clustering becomes 
available.</p>
