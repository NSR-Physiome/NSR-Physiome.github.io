    <h1>JSim RealNData Interpolation Specification</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<p>    This specification is preliminary and subject to change. Last revised: 06 Sep 
2006.</p>
<h2>  Implementation Specification</h2>
<p>    The RealNData.realVal(double[] xvals) method implements N-dimensional
interpolation based on grid values (not grid array indexes).  Various
interpolation algorithms may be implemented,  subject to the following
guidelines.</p>
<p>    The method may be called concurrently by several threads,  (even on the
same RealNData),  and so must be reentrant.  </p>
<p>    Interpolation must efficiently support both regular and irregular grids.  
Currently all model data is defined on regular grids, but this may change
in the future.  Data curves in project datasets is often defined on
irregular grids.  GridData.nearestInx(double xval) should be used to find
the surrounding grid indexes for an xval in an efficient manner.  Note
that IrregularGridData.nearestInx() currently (Sep 06) uses an inefficient
low-to-high search strategy.  This should be replaced by an efficient
binary search at some point in the future.</p>
<p>    Interpolation algorithms may use as many or as few nearby grid points as
is appropriate.  A linear algorithm may use as few as 2, or as many as 2^N
nearest neighbors.  A spline or other smooth algorithm may use even more
by drawing on non-nearest neighbors.  This specification is silent on the
number of neighbors used for interpolation. However, in does require
robustness when NaN's are encountered in one or more neighbors. All model
data arrays (RealNData) in initialized to NaNs at the start of a run.  
Values are calculated in an unpredictable order, depending upon the
planner/compiler.  When interpolation is requested, data values for some
neighbor grid points may be NaNs.  Currently (due to compiler limitations) all JSim 
model loops move from low index to high index,  but this should not be assumed
by interpolation algorithms as other calculation orders will, no doubt,  be
implemented in the future.</p>
<p>    Linear algorithms assign weight factors for each of the 2^N nearest neighbors
based on distance to the query xvals[],  with the returned value being a summation
of data values times weights.  Algorithms should not add zero weights
to summation in case the associated data value is NaN (IEEE spec says 0*NaN gives
NaN).  Furthermore, weights that are very nearly zero should be set to zero.
Here "very nearly zero" mean abs(x) < THRESH where THRESH is a static parameter
currently recommended to have value 1e-7.</p>
<p>    Note: As AS points out,  the current THRESH is 1e-7 times the 
minimum grid delta,  which is unit incompatible with the dimensionless weights.
Therefore,  the current threshold is non-sensical.  </p>
<p>    How to extend this NaN-protection policy to non-linear algorithms that sample
non-nearest neighbors has yet to be defined.</p>
<p>    It may be assumed that the GridData's overwhich the queried RealNData 
assumes values have non-NaN values.</p>
<p>    xvals[] query outside grid bounds but within one grid delta should return values
at grid bounds.  When the query is more than one delta outside grid bounds, this the
value returned may be either NaN or the value at grid bounds.  Future versions of this
spec will probably pick one or the other but, as of this writing, it is not completely
clear which is best.</p>
<h3>  Verification Specification</h3>
<p>    There are 3 types of verification required: accuraccy, robustness and performance.</p>
<h4>    Accuraccy verification</h4>
<p>      AS will provide model/project files that demonstrate smooth and correct
interpolation behaviour for NaN-less RealNData objects.  These files will be
incorporated into the JSIMSRC/VERIFY/interp suite.</p>
<h4>    Robustness</h4>
<p>      EB will provide model files that check for undesirable NaNs generated at
run-time.  These files will be incorporated into the JSIMSRC/VERIFY/interp suite.
AS should feel free to contribute any additional NaN problem models he discovers
during testing.</p>
<h4>    Performance</h4>
<p>      EB will provide a JSim/data/InterpTest.java for assessing algorithm 
performance.  Run via $JSIMSRC/build/jsinterpperf</p>
