<p>    JSim software is developed at the University of Washington by the 
National Simulation Resource, James B. Bassingthwaighte, director,
and is supported by NIH/NIBIB grant EB01973-22.</p>
<p>    JSim software was designed and written primarily by Erik
Butterworth. It is currently maintained by Bart Jardine. Other NSR staff contributing code to the project include
Andy Matuszkiewicz, Eric Lawson, Gary Raymond, Lucian Smith, Zheng Li, 
Mike Kellen, Lucian Smith and 
Asa Packer.</p>
<p>    Andreas Schwab has contributed additional code relating to the
MacIntosh port of JSim.</p>
<p>    The JSim logo was designed by Tania Butterworth.</p>
<p>    JSim makes extensive use of the Java computer language designed and
distributed by <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> .</p>
<p>    JSim language processing makes use of the following toolkits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/">CUP</a>
parser generator by Scott Hudson, Frank Flannery, C. Scott Ananian;</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/">JLex</a>
lexical analyzer generator.</li>

</ul>

<p>    JSim plots and graphs are produced using the <a href="http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/sgt/">Scientific Graphics
Toolkit</a> , by Donald Denbo.  Thanks
and credit are also due to his sponsors <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a> and
the <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/">PMEL/EPIC group</a> .</p>

<p>    JSim XML processing makes use of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html">Xerces2 Java 
Parser</a> distributed by 
<a href="http://apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation</a> </p>

<p> JSim SBML processing makes use of the <a 
href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libsbml library</a>.</p>

<p>    The JSim computational engine makes use of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html">Radau and
Dopri5</a> solvers for
ordinary differential equations, written by E. Hairer and G. Wanner;</li>
<li>The CVODE solver for ordinary differential equations was written by
Scott D. Cohen, Alan C. Hindmarsh, Radu Serban,and Dan Shumaker at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is copyrighted by The Regents
of the University of California.</li>
<li>The Tom690 and Toms731 solvers for partial differential equations
written by Martin Berzins. These are available from 
<a href="http://netlib.org">netlib.org</a> ;</li>
<li>The ggopt optimization algorithm is based on work by T. Glad, A. A.
Goldstein, J. B. Bassingthwaighte, I. S. Chan, and I. B. Russak.  Our
implementation utilizes the blas and linpackd math packages available from
<a href="http://netlib.org">netlib.org</a> ;</li>
<li>The NL2SOL optimization algorithm was written by
John E. Dennis, Jr., David M. Gay, and Roy E. Welsh, and our
implementation is a modification of their source code.</li>
<li>The Sensop optimzation algorithm was originally written by Joseph 
Chan, and later improved by Rick King, Asa Packer and Gary 
Raymond.</li>
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a> Java Matrix 
package.</li>
<li>JSim's NelderMead optimizer, originally developed by J.A. Nelder and
R. Mead (Computer Journal, 1965, vol 7, pp 308-313), is based on an
<a href="http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/Minimisation.html">implementation</a> 
by <a href="http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga">Dr Michael Thomas Flanagan</a> .</li>
<li>Simulated annealing was originally developed by
S. Kirkpatrick and C. D. Gelatt and M. P. Vecchi.  JSim's multiprocessing
implementation was written by Gary Raymond.</li>
<li>JSim's Bessel functions (besseli0, besseli1, besseljn, 
besselkn, besselyn) and error functions (erf, erfc) are from the <a href
