<h1>Calling Java Code From MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>    This document describes the process of defining and using Java
procedural code within MML models. </p>

<p> Prerequisites: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">Using Functions and Procedures in
MML</a>
<li>Familiarity with the Java programming language</li>
</ul>

<p>    Java code can be called from MML via either class or java source F&P.
Class F&P access pre-compiled Java classes and is recommended only for
JSim internal developers.  This document will address java source F&P in
which Java source code is embedded within MML and compiled at model build
time.  This mechanism guarantees maximum compatibility with future JSim
releases.</p>
<p>Note: Variables and realDomain variables that are labeled 'private'  are not available to Java functions and procedures when run as a Java applet over the web from a remote server (By default all variables and domains are public). The JSim compiler will complain that the variable is 'unknown'. The same code will compile and run fine when run locally.
</p>
<p>    The remainder of this document shows several examples of calling Java 
code from MML.  For the complete Application Programmer Interface 
(API), see <a href="Devel_API.html">The JSim Public API</a> .  Examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#example1">Example 1</a> - a scalar function;</li>
<li><a href="#example2">Example 2</a> - a non-scalar function;</li>
<li><a href="#example3">Example 3</a> - a procedure.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.physiome.org/jsim/models/webmodel/NSR/BR77pkDetect/">Example 4</a> - a procedure used within an electrophysiology model to detect peaks.</li>

</ul>
<h2>  <a name="example1">Example 1</a></h2>
<p>    In the following example, a java source function "gmean" is defined
that accepts two scalar arguments and returns their geometric mean.  The
main program defines a variable v(t) as the geometric mean of t and t^3,
which should thus be equal to t^2:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Func_Java/jmean.mod"); ?>

<p>    The first paragraph comprises the gmean function declaration. The
keyword "real" indicates that the function returns a real number.
(Currently, real is the only supported function data type.  Other data
types may be supported in the future.)  The keyword "source" indicates
that the function will be defined in terms on source code within MML.  
The name "gmean" follows the keyword "function", giving a unique name to
this function.  Function names must follow standard MML naming
conventions.  The argument list following the function name indicates this
function takes exactly two scalar arguments.  (Non-scalar arguments use
the @ directive, described later in this document).</p>
<p>    The "language" clause inside the function declaration indicates the
procedural code will follow the <a href="Devel_API.html">JSim Java Model API</a> . The
"maincode" clause contains the java procedural code.  Conventions for this
code are fully described in <a href="Devel_API.html">The JSim Java API</a> .  In
brief, the modeler specified maincode block is copied into a double
returning dynamic Java method, whose calling arguments are RealNData
objects named a and b.  RealNData has a method realVal() returning the
value of a scalar variable.  The return statement is required for a real
function.  It's omission will cause a compiler error.</p>
<p>    The second paragraph comprises the main line of the MML model.  In
this case, gmean will be called once for each t. Although only a single
equation using gmean is present in this example, multiple uses of gmean,
including nested uses, are supported. It should be noted that incautious
use of static methods within maincode can break this nesting ability.</p>

<h2>  <a name="example2">Example 2</a></h2>
<p>    The first example is trivial because the desired functionality could
more easily be obtained simply using MML.  This is the case for most
situations involving scalar arguments.  Function and procedures become
more useful when passing multi-dimensional arguments because the looping
constructs within Java are more general than those available in MML.</p>
<p>    In the following example, one-dimensional integration is implemented
as a java source function:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Func_Java/jintegral.mod"); ?>

<p>    The MML @ construct is used here twice.  In the function declaration,
u@t indicates that the single function argument must be one-dimensional.  
When the function is called u@t, which should be read "u for all t",
indicates that u values for all t should be passed to integral.  If a
function's declared argument dimensions do not match the arguments passed
at call time, MML will alert the modeler at compile time.</p>
<p>    RealNData have a method grid(int i), which provides access to the
associated data grid(s) of a multidimensional variable.  Since the
function argument is not scalar, realVal(int[]) replaces realVal()  as the
method used to access argument values at various grid points. Again, see
the <a href="Devel_API.html">JSim Public API</a> for further information.</p>
<p>    Multiple @ constructs can be used for higher dimensional function
arguments.</p>

<h2>  <a name="example3">Example 3</a></h2>
<p>    In the following example a procedure, rather than a function is 
demonstrated.  The procedure "reverse" takes a one-dimensional input 
argument,  reverses the order of the data,  and places the result in
a one-dimensional output argument: </p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Func_Java/jreverse.mod"); ?>

<p>    The keywords "java" and "procedure" indicate that the embedded code
block(s) will follow the JSim Java Model API for procedures.  Most
comments above regarding functions apply equally to procedures,  with 
a few differences noted below.</p>
<p>    The procedure argument list separates input arguments from output 
arguments with a semi-colon,  with inputs listed first.  This example 
has one input and one output argument.</p>
<p>    The maincode block returns no value as is appropriate for
a procedure.  The RealNData
method set(int, double) provides a means to set the value of output
arguments.  Again, see the <a href="Devel_API.html">JSim Public API</a> for further
information.</p>
