<h1>Calling C Code From MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document describes the process of defining and using C
procedural code within MML models.  The MML mechanisms used are called
functions and procedures (F&P).  The functionality described here is somewhat problematic
under Windows.</p>

<p> Prerequisites: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="MML_Func_Intro.html">Using Functions and Procedures in 
MML</a>
<li>Familiarity with the C programming language</li>
</ul>

<h2>  Overview</h2>
<p>    C code can be called from MML via either source or native F&P.  In
both cases, the C code must comform to <a href="MML_API_C.html">The JSim C API</a> .</p>
<p>    Source F&P embed C source code within MML which is compiled at model
build time.  This method is the simplest to write and understand, is
fairly portable between architectures and is appropriate for modest sized
F&P.  Using Source F&P requires a C compiler be configured in your JSim
installation.  See <a href="Admin_Custom.html">Customizing a JSim Installation</a> for
instructions on doing this, or pass the information along to your system
administrator.  Note that this customization is problematic under Windows.</p>
<p>    Native F&P link to pre-compiled C native libraries. This method 
is somewhat more complicated than source F&P,  but may be useful if:
<ol>
<li> you wish to distribute a model to a collaborator who does not
have access to a C compiler;</li>
<li> your C code base is large enough that you don't wish to recompile
/relink each time your model builds.</li>

</ol>
</p>
<p>    Native libraries required by a model are not saved in model or project
files, and so must to separately distributed to collaborators.  Note that
native libraries are not portable between different computer architectures
and operating systems,  so what runs for you,  may not run for him.</p>
<p>    This document shows several examples of C source F&P.  Afterward,
the same examples are done using native F&P.</p>

<h2>  <a name="example1">Example 1</a></h2>
<p>    In the following example, a C source function "gmean" is defined
that accepts two scalar arguments and returns their geometric mean.  The
main program defines a variable v(t) as the geometric mean of t and t^3,
which should thus be equal to t^2:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/cmean.mod"); ?>

<p>    The first paragraph comprises the gmean function declaration.  The
keyword "source" indicates that the function will be defined in terms on
source code within MML.  The keyword "real" indicates that the function
returns a real number. (Currently, real is the only supported function
data type.  Other data types may be supported in the future.)  The name
"gmean" follows the keyword "function", giving a unique name to this
function.  Function names must follow standard MML naming conventions.  
The argument list following the function name indicates this function
takes exactly two scalar arguments.  (Non-scalar arguments use the @
directive, described later in this document).</p>
<p>    The "language" clause inside the function declaration indicates the
procedural code will follow the <a href="MML_C_API">JSim C Model API</a> . The
"maincode" clause contains the C procedural code.  Conventions for this
code are fully described in <a href="MML_API_C.html">The JSim C API</a> .  In brief,
the modeler specified maincode block is copied into a double returning C
function, whose calling arguments are JSimArg structure pointers named a
and b.  JSimArg has a double array realVal, whose 0th element is the value
for a scalar argument.  The JSIM_RETURN statement is required when
returning from a function in order to clean up temporary memory
allocation.  It's omission will cause memory leaks.</p>
<p>    The second paragraph comprises the main line of the MML model.  In
this case, gmean will be called once for each t. Although only a single
equation using gmean is present in this example, multiple uses of gmean,
including nested uses, are supported. It should be noted that incautious
use of static variables within maincode can break this nesting ability.</p>
<h2>  <a name="example2">Example 2</a></h2>
<p>    The first example is trivial because the desired functionality could
more easily be obtained simply using MML.  This is the case for most
situations involving scalar arguments.  Function and procedures become
more useful when passing multi-dimensional arguments because the looping
constructs within Java are more general than those available in MML.</p>
<p>    In the following example, one-dimensional integration is implemented
as a java source function:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/cintegral.mod"); ?>

<p>    The MML @ construct is used here twice.  In the function declaration,
u@t indicates that the single function argument must be one-dimensional.  
When the function is called u@t, which should be read "u for all t",
indicates that u values for all t should be passed to integral.  If a
function's declared argument dimensions do not match the arguments passed
at call time, MML will alert the modeler at compile time.</p>
<p>    JSimArg have a JSimGrid array grids, which provides access to the
associated data grid(s) of a multidimensional variable.  Since the
function argument is not scalar, realVal array access is done at various
grid points. Again, see the <a href="MML_API_C.html">JSim C API</a> for further
information.</p>
<p>    Multiple @ constructs can be used for higher dimensional function
arguments.</p>
<h2>  <a name="example3">Example 3</a></h2>
<p>    In the following example a procedure, rather than a function is 
demonstrated.  The procedure "reverse" takes a one-dimensional input 
argument,  reverses the order of the data,  and places the result in
a one-dimensional output argument:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/creverse.mod"); ?>

<p>    The keywords "C" and "procedure" indicate that the embedded code
block(s) will follow the JSim C Model API for procedures.  Most
comments above regarding functions apply equally to procedures,  with 
a few differences noted below.</p>
<p>    The procedure argument list separates input arguments from output
arguments with a semi-colon, with inputs listed first.  This example has
one input and one output argument.</p>
<p>    The maincode block returns no value as is appropriate for
a procedure,  but the JSIM_RETURN() statement is still required
for freeing allocated memory.  </p>
<h2>  <a name="example4">Example 4</a></h2>
<p>    The following is a reworking of source example 1 as a native 
C function.  The model file looks like this:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/nmean.mod"); ?>

<p>    The function declaration specifies that the external library mylib
will contain a double-returning function mygmean conforming to the 
JSim C Model API.  The "language" clause indicates that JSim should 
link to the function using your operating system's conventions for the
C language.  The code for mylib.c is as follows:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/mylib.c"); ?>

<p>    jsimapi.h, distributed with JSim, defines the structures and macros
you'll need.  JSIM_REAL_FUNCTION() expands to a function header for
mygmean.  Due to Java's JNI mechanism for calling C, the name of the
library in which the function will reside must be specified.  JSIM_INIT
performs certain initialization operations, and JSIM_ARG() returns
pointers to the allocated arguments.  The remaining three lines are 
the same code that was used in source example 1.</p>

<p>    Before the model can be run, mylib.c must be compiled into a shared
library appropriate for your system.  The simplest way to do this is use
the script installed when customizing JSim for C compilation (see Overview
above).  For example, on a Linux system with the C compile script
installed in $JSIMHOME/local (one of several options), the command would
be:</p>

<pre>
$JSIMHOME/local/jscompile_c $JSIMHOME $PWD mylib
</pre>

<p>    This creates the library file libmylib.so under Linux.  Other
operating systems have other native library naming conventions. The
library should be placed at an convenient location within JSIMPATH so that
it can be found at model run time.  See <a href="User_Ref.html">JSim User Reference
Manual</a> for information on JSIMPATH.</p>
<p>    Building large multi-module native libraries requires great expertise
in both C compiling and linking issues. Such details are beyond the scope
of this document.  The JSim C compile script cannot be used directly for
such large projects,  but experts may easily analyze the script to extract
appropriate details.</p>

<h2>  <a name="example5">Example 5</a></h2>
<p>    Native libraries may contain one or more entry points for JSim F&P.
Below,  we combine the code for examples 2 and 3 above into a single
model and library (newlib).  The model is as follows:</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/ncombo.mod"); ?>

<p>    The code for newlib.c is as follows:

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Func_C/newlib.c"); ?>

<p>    Note that JSIM_PROCEDURE is used instead of JSIM_REAL_FUNCTION for
crev.  Also note the use of JSIM_ERROR to alert the user to mis-matched
array lengths.</p>
