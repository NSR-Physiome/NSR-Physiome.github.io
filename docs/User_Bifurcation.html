<h1>JSim Bifurcation Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Bifurcation analysis explores mulitple stationary states, both
stable and unstable, within
a model.  There are several approaches within JSim:</p>

<ul>

<li>Problems with multiple stable stationary states can be explored 
by writing the analysis directly within the model.  Curated NSR models
using this approach are listed <a 
href="http://www.physiome.org/Models/modelDB/adv_find.php?keyword_1=bifurcation&logic_search=sAND&keyword_2=&fmadv_keyterm=key_terms&fmadv_modelname=model_name&fmadv_descript=description&fmadv_author=author">
here</a>.</li>

<li>A bifurcation analysis tab for JSim is currently under development.
In this tab,  the user specify a parameter of interest and a range of exploration.
The analysis with link to the <a href="http://cmvl.cs.concordia.ca/auto/">AUTO</a> package to generate a 
bifurcation diagram.  The AUTO package allow exploration of both stable and unstable 
stationary states.  Release of this feature is expected in mid-2012.</li>

<li>Export of JSim models to <a href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html">XPP/XPPAUT</a>
is currently under development.  Once complete,  users may export their models
to the XPPAUT system for bifurcation analysis there.</li>

</ul>
