<h2>  <a name="public">Public, Private and Extern variables</a></h2>
<p>    To make models adequately general, JSim allows some variables to be
specified as "extern", which means they are not calculated by the model,
but are provided to the model externally by the JSim user environment.  
The run-time environment requires that explicit values be assigned to all
externs before a model can be run.  Extern variables are considered
completely constrained, so no additional MML constraints are required.  A
sample voltage inverter follows:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/inverter.proj"); ?>

<p>    MML variables may be designated as "private", which means they are not
visible to the run-time interface.  This can be useful in reducing clutter
if a variable is uninteresting at run-time.  Extern variables may not be
private. Variable neither private nor extern are considered public.:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/rabbit.proj"); ?>

<p>    Run-time output:</p>
<pre>
a=5
c=30
</pre>

<p>    Public variables may be redeclared as extern or private.  This is
accomplished with the keywords extern or private followed immediately by
the variable name and can be useful when sub-variables are created
automatically as public, as with domains.  The following example makes
t.min private,  making it unchangable at run-time (see following section).:
</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/startzero.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="choice">Choice variables</a></h2>

<p> Choice variables are integer variables whose value is set by the
user via a menu of defined values.  For example:</p>
<pre>
choice fruit("apple", "banana", "cherry") = 2;
</pre>

<p>    Above,  the label "apple" is associated with the value 1, "banana"
with 2, and "cherry" with 3.  "banana" will be the default value.</p>
<p>    You may arbitrarily assign associated numeric values by using
integers as arguments:</p>
<pre>
choice zork(0, "zero", "one", "two", 10, "ten", "eleven") = 10;
</pre>

<p>    Here the numeric values correspond in the natural way to the text
labels.  Only the values 0, 1, 2, 10 and 11 will be allowed.</p>
<p>    If a choice variable is calculated from other 
variables,  it becomes an output variable.  In this case,  it behaves 
no differently than any other integer variable.  Example:
<pre>
int n = 3;
choice fruit("apple", "banana", "cherry");
fruit = n;
</pre>

<p>    At this time,  choice variables are all scalars,  and have no 
associated domains.  </p>

<h2>  <a name="deriv">Symbolic Derivatives</a></h2>
<p>    JSim can solve some variables via symbolic differentiation of other
fully constrained variables.:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/deriv1.proj"); ?>

<p>    JSim currently can only differentiate variables which are constrained
by explicit algebraic constraints.  It cannot take derivatives of extern
variables, implicitly constrained variables, ODE variables, etc. Since the
chain rule from calculus is used, the differentiated variable must depend
only on other variables with explicit algebraic constraints.  In the
following example, the attempt to differentiate c would generate an error
due to c's nested dependence upon the extern variable a:</p>

<pre>
math deriv2 {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.max=10; t.delta=1;
  extern a(t);
  real b(t) = a^2 + t;
  real c(t) = exp(b);
  real d(t) = c:t;      // solve d by differentiating c
}
</pre>

<p> The colon (derivative)  operator may also be applied to expressions.  
It has high precedence, so this requires the use of paretheses:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/deriv3.proj"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="help">Variable Properties</a></h2>

<p> Properties allow tagged values to be associated with a variable.  
Currently, only string values are supported. The "desc" and "help" 
properties are defined by default.  The "desc" property is a concise 
one-line description of the variable.  The "help" property is free-form 
text that may extend to multiple lines. Additional properties may be 
specified on a model-by-model basis with the MML "property" command.  
Additional properties, if defined, may be used to label variables for 
various automated analyses currently under development.  For example, 
the additional property "fma" might be defined that connects a variable 
the Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology.  Properties are assigned by 
optional assignments that should be clear from the following example: 
</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/prop1.proj"); ?>

<p>    If defined, the "desc" and "help" property values will appear in the
help popup for a variable in the GUI.  The
"desc" and "help" properties are normally defined as double-quoted
strings, with "\n" being interpreted as a line separator for v.help::</p>
<p>    If a property value text is extensive, it may be simpler to use the
alternative double-brace specification for multi-line text:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Topics/prop2.proj"); ?>

<p>    When adding customizable help to a model, remember that model help
automatically includes the default value and unit (if any) for input
variables and the relevant equations and unit (if any) for output
variables.  Including such information in the customizable help is
strongly discouraged.</p>
