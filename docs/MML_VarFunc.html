<h1>Using Variable Functions in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<p>This document explains variable functions (VFs), which are MML's 
syntax for treating a model variable v as a function v().  For example, 
values of a dynamic scalar variable v(t) may queried via v(expression), 
such as v(t-delay) or v(w(t)). This document discusses VFs in their full 
generality.  Those whose interest is limited to creating delay lines, 
should instead see the document <a href="MML_Delay.html">Using Delay 
Lines in MML</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="basics">VF Basics</a></h2>

<p>In MML, declaring a variable 1-dimensional v implies a function 
v(expr), where "expr" is an algebraic expression of other model 
variables, that can be used in model equations.  Similarly, an 
N-dimensional variable v implies a function v(expr1, expr2, ... exprN). 
In the following example, w is calculated using the VF call v(t^2):</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfb1.proj") ?>

<p>When the model runs, each value for v(t) will be calculated by 
linearly interpolating u values at the t grid points closest to t^2. 
Since sin(t) is not linear, the interpolation introduces some error. 
v(t) is a better approximation of sin(t^2) when t.delta is small than 
when t.delta is large.  In general, VFs of non-linear expressions always 
introduce some interpolation error, which may be minimized
by choosing an appropriate t.delta.</p>

<p>Using the default time grid, the required interpolation values are 
always well-defined because 0 &lt t &lt 1 implies t^2 is also.  However, if we 
set t.max=2, running the model will generate an error because the 
required interpolation value u(4) is out of bounds.  We 
can prevent this run-time error by using an "if" clause:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfb2.proj") ?>

<p>Another type of problem occurs if you set t.min=-1, all the values of 
v(t) for t &lt 0 are NaNs.  This is because the calculations of u and v 
proceed in tandem from t.min to t.max.  At t=t.min=-1, calculating v(-1) 
requires u(1), which hasn't been calculated yet, thus resulting in a 
NaN.  In an ideal world, the JSim compiler would recognize this 
calculation order dependency and reorder the run-time calculations to 
accomodate it.  In reality, unfortunately, this sort of order 
recognition is a very hard problem in complex models, and is presently 
without satisfactory solution.  For now, modeler must be aware of 
calculation order dependency when writing VFs.  One simple way to do
this is by following the examples in this document.</p>

<h2><a name="summary">Quick Summary of VF Basics</a></h2>

<li>Compensate for VF non-linearity by choosing an appropriately fine 
grid spacing.</li>
<li>Protect VF calls from domain value overflow (or underflow) by using
"if" clauses;</li>
<li>Be aware of calculation order dependencies, following examples in
this document whenever possible.</li>

<h2><a name="delay">Creating Delay Lines using VFs</a></h2>

<p>VFs are one of several mechanism for creating delay lines.
All are discussed in the document <a href="MML_Delay.html">Using Delay
Lines in MML</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="interp">Data Driven Functional Relationships and 
VFs</a></h2>

<p>VFs also provide a mechanism for incorporating external (often
experimental) data into a model.  Consider an initially charged capacitor(C), 
draining its charge(Q) over a coupled resistor(R).  A simple model
for this system, assuming constant R, is as follows:</p>

<?php jsText("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfrc1.mod"); ?>

<p>Now suppose R is a non-linear function of the applied voltage
that has been measured experimentally and stored in a 
JSim-compatible data set (see <a href="User_DataSets.html">Data Files 
and Project Data Sets</a>).  MML for this system is below:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfrc3.proj"); ?>

<p>This model introduces a new realDomain vr representing the 
voltage over R and that R itself is now declared "extern" with domain 
vr.  This construct allows R's values to be drawn from the external
data set via a JSim function generator.  Furthermore,  the ODE for
Q uses the VF R(V) to calculate the resistance appropriate to the 
current voltage. Also note that the current voltage V(t) is a "real", 
not a "realDomain", and so R cannot declare V as its domain.</p>


<h2><a name="bc">VFs and PDE Boundaries</a></h2>

<p>Models containing PDEs in series can exhibit a VF-related problem 
with NaNs if boundary conditions are not properly handled.  
Consider flow through a stirred tank C2(t) and an spatial distributed 
pipe C1(t,x).  The pipe's input (C1in) is drawn from the tank, and the 
pipe's output (C1out) empties back into the tank.  A first attempt at 
coding might look as follows:</p>

<?php jsText("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfbc1.mod"); ?>

<p>Here we calculate C1out at the pipe's right-hand boundary using a VF 
C1out=C1(t,x.max).  Unfortunately, this code will fail at run-time with 
a "NaNs detected" message because the VF doesn't provide enough 
information to the compiler to sort out the circular dependencies of C1 
and C2.  If, however, we use a "when" clause to calculate C1out, the 
compiler can recognize the C1/C2 dependencies, and order the 
calculations properly:</p>

<?php jsText("examples/MML_VarFunc/vfbc2.mod"); ?>

<p>This model will run without the NaN error.  Here, the proper solution 
is to <em>not</em> use a VF, but to use a "when" clause instead.</p>
