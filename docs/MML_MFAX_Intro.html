<h1>Introduction to the MFAX BCL</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>    This document is a tutorial for writing JSim models using the MFAX
Biological Component Library (BCL).  MFAX stands for a Metabolite Flow and
Exchange, and contains a set of components appropriate for chemical
network models in multiple compartments with convective flow and membrane
transport between those compartments.</p>

<h2>  <a name="simple">Simple example</a></h2>
<p>    The following model uses the MFAX BCL to describe the dimerization of
a chemical species A in a single compartment:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax01.mod"); ?>

<p>    The
line "import MFAX" loads the MFAX BCL so that is can be used in this
model.  The block beginning "MFAX example1" gives the MFAX BCL model
specifics.  A BCL block must be given a name (here, example1) and is
delimited by curly braces.  Note that MML and BCLs are case sensitive and
that white space (spaces, tabs, line breaks) is ignored. Text following
double slashes (//) or between /&#042; and &#042;/ is ignored as
commentary as in Java or C++.</p>
<p>    Within the example1 MFAX block, five components (t, A, B, C, R) are
defined, each corresponding to a physical entity. Each component may have
sub-variables (t.min, t.max, t.delta, C.vol, R.kf, R.kb) that must be
constrained so that model is completely specified.  Here are short
descriptions of the example1 components.</p>

<ul>
<li>Time:  The MFAX system requires you give a name to the variable
representing time (here t).  Time is implemented as an equally-spaced
grid.  The subvariables t.min and t.max represent the minimum and maximum
values for t respectively and t.delta represents the time-point
separation.</li>
<li>Chem:  A and B here are names for the two chemical species of interest.
Chems have no associated sub-variables that must be constrained.  Chem
names must start with an upper-case letter.</li>
<li>Compartment:  example1 has a single compartment named C.  
Compartments in MFAX are assumed to be "well-stirred tanks" so that all
chemical species are assumed to have uniform concentrations over C.  The
associated sub-variable C.vol represents the volume of C.</li>
<li>MassBalReaction: R here represents the reversible mass-balance reaction
A=2B taking place in compartment C.  The associated sub-variables R.kf
and R.kb represents the forward and backward equilibrium constants.</li>

</ul>
<p>    If you run example1 under JSim, the output shows variables C.A and
C.B, which represent the concentrations of A and B in compartment C, to be
uniformly zero.  More interesting results can be obtained by changing the
initial concentrations (variables C.A__init and/or C.B__init) from their
default values of zero and rerunning the model.</p>

<h2>  <a name="units">Using physical units</a></h2>
<p>    Example1 above is somewhat confusing because it is unclear what
physical units are appropriate when assigning variables.  For instance, is
C.vol 10 liters or 10 milliliters or what?  JSim supports, but does not
require, attaching physical units to components and variables.  In BCLs,
using physical units is normally recommended.  Example2 below adds
physical units to the previous example:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax02.mod"); ?>

<p>    JSim does not have a default units system or policy.  The line "import
nsrunit"  imports the distributed NSR units file for use in this model.  
The line "unit conversion on" turns on automated unit conversion.  The
unit conversion line is optional in plain MML, but is required when using
units with the MFAX BCL.  Additionally, four components (t, A, B and C)
are declared with physical units.  This is done by declaring the units
after the name of each component.</p>
<p>    Time t is declared in seconds.  The sub-variables t.min, t.max and
t.delta will also be in seconds.</p>
<p>    Compartment C is declared in liters.  The sub-variable C.vol will be
in liters.</p>
<p>    Chem A and B units are molar.  The concentration variables 
C.A and C.B will be molar. </p>
<p>    MassBalReaction R requires no unit declaration.  The units for
sub-variables R.kf and R.kb are calculated using the units for t, A and
B.  Here R.kf will have units 1/sec and R.kb units 1/molar/sec.</p>
<p>    JSim models support custom user-defined units, however importing the
distributed NSR unit file is appropriate for most users.  In the JSim GUI,
this file can be viewed in the Debug sub-tab of a model tab by selecting
"View system units file" from the View menu. See <a href="MML_Units.html">Using Units in
MML</a> for further information.</p>
<p>    The BCL author may make a range of choices in defining physical units,
so long as they are dimensionally compatible with the components internal
unit.  These internal units for example2 components are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time              sec</li>
<li>Chem              molar</li>
<li>Comparment        liter</li>
<li>MassBalReaction   dimensionless</li>

</ul>
<p>    Thus Time t could have been defines as sec, min or hour, but not as
meters.  Chem A could be defined as mM (millimolar), uM (micromolar), nM
(nanomolar), pM (picomolar), but not moles/(gram*liter). Compartment C
could have be defined as ml (milliliters), m^3 (cubic meters), foot^3
(cubic feet) but not m^2.  MassBalReaction R requires a dimensionless
unit, and the unit assigned has no effect on model calculations.</p>

<h2>  <a name="mml">Incorporating MML into BCL models</a></h2>
<p>    MML syntax allows tweaking a number of features of BCL models.  Examples
  include:</p>

<ol>
<li> adding additional variable and sub-variables to the model;</li>
<li> specifying custom calculations for variables;</li>
<li> specifying external inputs to a model;</li>
<li> cleaning up user interface by repressing some output variables.</li>

</ol>
<p>    This tutorial focuses on BCL,  so when a useful MML construct comes
up it will be mentioned only briefly,  and the user referred to 
<a href="MML_Intro.html">Writing a Simple MML Model</a> for further information.</p>
<h2>  <a name="conc">Setting concentrations</a></h2>
<p>    BCL authors may wish the initial concentrations in their models.  
This is accomplished via the MML "when" clause (see "Basics of MML"
for more info). In example2 above, the concentration variables were
C.A and C.B.  Example3 below sets the initial concentrations:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax03.mod"); ?>

<p>    Another possibility is having a particular concentration set over its
entire time course.  In example4 below, the B concentration increases
linearly because it is set by a pump in compartment C.  The A
concentration is determined using the B concentration and the reaction R:
</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax04.mod"); ?>

<p>    Declaring additional real variables (again, see "MML Basics") can help
to modularize BCL models:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax05.mod"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="more">More Component Types</a></h2>
<p>    In addition to the four component types so far described (Time, Chem,
Compartment, MassBalReaction), MFAX BCL provides about another dozen for
specification of other types chemical reactions and various methods of
passing chemicals between compartments.  Each new component type is
introduced in sections below.  Except as noted, a BCL model may declare
any number of components of each type, allowing for creation of
arbitrarily complex models.  Each new component's behavior in the model
will depend on how the BCL author sets or constrains the sub-variables
that are associated with the component.  To successfully incorporate a
component, the BCL author must understand the physical meaning of the
component, how to declare it in his model and the names and physical
significance of its sub-variables.  <a href="MML_MFAX_Ref.html">MFAX BCL Reference</a>
provides details each component type.</p>

<h2>  <a name="reac">Reaction Types</a></h2>
<p>    MFAX BCL provides three alternative components to specify chemical
reactions MassBalReaction, FluxReaction and FastReaction.</p>
<p>    MassBalReaction models a mass-balance reaction specified via forward
and backward equilibrium constants (kf and kb).  This has been covered
previously.</p>
<p>    FluxReaction models an arbitrary reaction specified by the forward net
flux variable (flux) whose units are compatible with moles/second.  For
example, example6 below models the enzyme mediated dimerization of A using
simple, irreversible, Michalis-Mentin kinetics:M</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax06.mod"); ?>

<p>    Modelers must take care so that flux is non-negative when species on
the right-hand side of the equation have zero concentration, and
non-positive when species on the left have zero concentration.  
Otherwise, negative values for the concentrations will result.  This is
mathematically correct behavior, although (obviously) physically
unrealistic.</p>
<p>    FastReaction models a mass-balance reaction that equilibrates
instantaneously relative to MassBalReactions and FluxReactions, specified
by a single equilibrium constant (k).  Mathematically, it is equivalent to
a MassBalReaction with very high kf and kb relative to other reactions,
but much more numerically efficient and accurate.  In example7 below,
there are two reactions R1 and R2, with R2 equilibrating much faster than
R1:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax07.mod"); ?>

<p>    Since FastReactions equilibrate instantaneously, it is possible to
overspecify a system using them.  Care must be taken that there is always
one "free" species that is not specified by a fast reaction or forced
concentration.  For example, the following system is 
over-specified:</p>

<pre>
import MFAX;
import nsrunit;
unit conversion on;
MFAX example8 {
  Time t sec;
  t.min=0; t.max=10; t.delta=1;
  Chem X molar, Y molar;
  Compartment C liter;
  C.vol = 10;
  FastReaction R(C, "X=2Y");
  R.k = 1;
  real k = 2 molar/sec;
  C.Xconc = k*t;
  C.Yconc = 2*k*t;
}
</pre>

<h2>  <a name="cons">Consumption and Production</a></h2>
<p>    Consumption and Production are components that add or remove a
chemical from a compartment.  The associated subvariable "flux" must be
compatible with mole/second.  In the example below, A is produced by
component Q1 in compartment C1 and is consumed by component Q2 in
compartment C2:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax09.mod"); ?>

<p>    Consumption and Production are both "slow" processes in that
FastReactions equilibrate instantaneously relative to them.  If the rate
variable goes negative, a Consumption component will function as a
Production and vice-versa.  In order to prevent negative concentrations,
Consumption components turn themselves off at zero concentrations.  
However, due to unresolved numeric method issues, small negative
concentrations may result.  This can be avoided by making Consumption
rates fall continuously to zero with concentration.</p>

<h2>  <a name="mem">Membrane and Transport</a></h2>
<p>    The components so far described model concentrations in one or more
compartments, but do not explicitly describe passage of molecules from one
compartment to another.  There are two mechanisms to do this. Membrane and
Transport components model transport across a membrane.  Various Flow
components describe convective flow between compartments.</p>
<p>    In the following example,  species A is produced in compartment C1
and is transported through a membrane to compartment C2:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax10.mod"); ?>

<p>    The Membrane construct requires two arguments, the two compartments it
connects.  Membranes have no inherent functionality (and have no
sub-variables), but serve as attachment points for Transports that pass
species across the Membrane.  A Transport construct requires two
arguments:  the membrane it's attached to, and the species transported.
TransportPS, in which the transport rate is determined via a permiability
surface-area product (sub-variable PS), is used in this example.  PS has
dimension liter/sec (derived from units for C1 and t).  The other
Transport currently available is TransportFlux, where the transport rate
is determined via a flux rate.  See the example below:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax10f.mod"); ?>

<p>  Other Transport components will be available in future JSim versions.</p>
<h2>  <a name="flow">Convective Flow</a></h2>
<p>    Flow, FlowSource, FlowSink and related components describe convective
flow between compartments.  Convective flow starts at a FlowSource, may
branch through any number of compartments, and must terminate at a
FlowSink.  The following example describes flow through two compartments,
with production of species A in the first:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax11.mod"); ?>

<p>    The FlowSource component (F1) takes a single argument, the Compartment
that it flows into.  The attached unit must be compatible with liter/sec.  
The sub-variable flow describes the rate of flow and inherits its unit
from the FlowSource.  "flow" may be time-variant, but negative values are
not supported.</p>
<p>    A Flow component (F2) describes flow between two compartments and thus
takes two arguments, the input compartment (C1) and the output compartment
(C2).  F2's rate of flow in a Flow component is determined by the rate of
flow out of C1 (determined by FlowSource F1) and so does not need to be
(and should not be) set explicitly.  Flow components do not require unit
declarations.</p>
<p>    Convective flow disappears from the system via FlowSink component, which
takes as it's single argument the Compartment it drains.  As with the 
Flow component,  FlowSink's rate of flow is not set explicitly, but is 
determined from the inflow to the attached compartment.  FlowSink 
components do not require unit declarations.</p>
<p>    Any number of Compartment, Flow and FlowSink components may be
specified, however currently JSim only supports a single FlowSource.  The
network must be such that any Compartment with an attached Flow, FlowSink
or FlowSource must have exactly one input flow and one output flow.</p>

<h2>  <a name="branch">Branching Flows</a></h2>
<p>    Diverging and converging flow streams are supported via the FlowJunc
(flow junction) component.  FlowJunc represents a volumeless junction in
which one or more input flows may be mixed and one or more output flows
may be split.  A FlowJunc may be specified in place of a Compartment in
FlowSource, Flow and FlowSink declarations.  FlowJunc components do not
require unit declarations.  A FlowJunc must have at least one inflow and
at least one outflow.  In the following example one FlowJunc (J1) splits
the incoming flow to pass through two compartments (C1 and C2), and
another FlowJunc (J2) merges the two compartment outflows before pass to a
FlowSink (F6):</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax12.mod"); ?>

<p>    Notice the two FlowJunc weighting variables J1.F2wgt and J1.F3wgt.  
These specify what proportion of J1's output will pass to F2 and F3
respectively.  The weights have a default value of 1, which results in an
even split between all paths.  In example12 however, the weights are set
so that twice as much (2/3 of the total) flow will pass through F2.</p>

<h2>  <a name="recirc">Recirculating Flow</a></h2>
<p>    The MFAX BCL supports recirculating flows, however a FlowSource is
always required to specify the flow rate.  To allow this, a FlowSource may
be declared with two arguments (input and output) instead of the one
(output only) which has been used in previous examples.  Using FlowSource
with two arguments makes it like a Flow component, but with the
subvariable flow settable.  The following example shows recirculating flow
between two compartments (C1 and C2).  Notice that a FlowSink is not
required:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax13.mod"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="inject">Injections</a></h2>
<p>    The Inject component models an injection of a chemical species into a
Flow or FlowSource.  The Inject component requires two arguments:  the
Flow or FlowSource to inject into, and the Chem to inject.  The Inject
component is specified without units.  The rate of injection is determined
by the "fluw" subvariable whose units are compatible with moles/sec.  The
exact units are dependent upon the units of the Chem and Time components.  
The example below shows flow into and out of a single compartment (C1),
with an injection of species A attached to the FlowSource:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax14.mod"); ?>

<p> The injection rate variable (here I1.Arate) has no default value,
and so must be constrained for the model to be completely specified.  
It is often useful to allow the user to specify the injection rate
function at run-time from an external data source.  The BCL author
accomodates this via the general MML mechanism for specifying a
variable as external (see <a href="MML_Intro.html">Writing a Simple
MML Model</a> for further information):</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax15.mod"); ?>

<h2>  <a name="private">Privatizing sub-variables</a></h2>
<p>    A concentration sub-variable is created for each Chem inside each
Compartment.  Depending on model dynamics, some of these concentrations
may always be zero, and thus not useful to look at.  JSim is not yet smart
enough to repress these variables in the run-time environment, however the
BCL author may do this using the general MML mechanism for specifying a
variable as private (see <a href="MML_Intro.html">Writing a Simple MML Model</a> ).  
In the example below, species B never appears in Compartment C1, so the
concentration there is privatized:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_MFAX_Intro/mfax16.mod"); ?>

<p>    This mechanism can be used to privatize any variable, not just
concentration within compartments.</p>
