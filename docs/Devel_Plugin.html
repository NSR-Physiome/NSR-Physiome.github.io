<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>    This document describes how to write JSim plugins, code modules that
extend JSim's functionality at run-time.  Familiarity with both JSim and
Java software engineering is assumed.</p>

<h2>  <a name="basic">Plugin Basics</a></h2>
<p>    A JSim plugin is a Java archive (.jar file) that is loaded into jsim,
jsbatch or jsserver at run-time to enhance functionality for some user
purpose.  For example, a user might wish to output model data in a format
not currently provided by JSim.  This format may be peculiar to a the
user's current project, but of little value to the general JSim user
community.  Here a JSim plugin provides the advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>the public JSim distribution is not weighed down with code specific
to a single user;</li>
<li>the user may implement the plugin without waiting for the JSim
development team to allocate time for his particular project.</li>

</ul>
<p>    A plugin's <strong>type</strong> determines the sort of functionality the plugin
will have within JSim.  The example above is of the DataFormat type.  A
plugin's <strong>variant</strong> is a unique name for the plugin, within all
available plugins of the same type.  Suppose the example above was
implemented via a plugin MyDataFormat.jar, with type DataFormat and
variant "mine".  Below, the plugin is loaded via the jsbatch -plugin
switch, and accessed via the -ofmt switch:
<pre>
      jsbatch -f some.proj -plugin MyDataFormat.jar -ofmt mine
</pre>
</p>
<p>    Note that -ofmt does not normally accept "mine" as a valid format.
However,  with the plugin "mine" becomes acceptable (and functional).</p>
<p>    JSim has a client-server architecture, and plugins may enhance either
the client or server operation.  When (as by default) jsim or jsbatch is
run using the local server, either type of plugin will be operational.
When running the JSim applet or running jsim or jsbatch on a remote
server, only client-side plugins will be operational.  Remote server-side
plugins must be installed via jsserver.</p>
<h2>  <a name="create">Creating a plugin</a></h2>
<p>    For each type of plugin, there is an associated JSim internal class
which implements that functionality.  For example, the
JSim.data.DataFormat class implements the functionality of the plugin type
DataFormat.  The plugin .jar file must contain a new subclass of the
internal class.  In our example MyDataFormat extends JSim.data.DataFormat.
The new subclass, along with supporting classes and resources are bundled
into the plugin .jar.  The manifest for a plugin .jar must have the
following entries that allow JSim to recognize the plugin and use is
appropriately.  Values for each entry correspond to the above example:
<pre>
      JSimPluginType: DataFormat
      JSimPluginVariant: mine
      JSimPluginClass: MyDataFormat
</pre>
</p>
<p>    The plugin classes may be compiled against the JSimClient and
JSimServer distributed jar files found in $JSIMHOME/lib.  A client-side
plugin will need only JSimClient.jar, a server-side plugin will need both.</p>
<p>    Details for plugin programming may be found in the <a href="Devel_API.html">JSim Public 
API</a> .</p>

<p> See $JSIMHOME/doc/plugins in your JSim distribution for some 
examples of JSim plugins and how to build them (on a Macintosh, the doc 
directory is in the installation directory).  More complete 
documentation for plugin programming may be found in the <a 
href="JSim_API.html">JSim Public API</a> .</p>

<p>    Currently supported plugin types:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#datafmt">DataFormat</a> : allow import and export of JSim data in 
formats not currently supported by JSim.</li>
<li><a href="#graphic">Graphic</a> : allow customized graphics representation of
JSim model properties, constraints and (possibly live) data.</li>
<li><a href="#easel">ModelEasel</a> : allow point-and-click model building within
JSim.</li>
<li><a href="#optim">Optimizer</a> : allow use of novel optimization
algorithms not currently supported by JSim.</li>

</ul>
<p>    Planned future plugin types:</p>

<ul>
<li>ODESolver : allow external ODE solvers in JSim model run-time
calculations.</li>
<li>if you have ideas for other JSim plugin types, please contact
the JSim development team.</li>

</ul>
<h2>  <a name="datafmt">DataFormat plugins</a></h2>
<p>      A DataFormat plugin allows import and export of JSim data in formats
not currently supported by JSim. This client-side plugin extends the JSim
internal class JSim.data.DataFormat.  DataFormat may implement an
associated DataReader (for importing data) or a DataWriter (for exporting
data) or both.  Each DataFormat defines a set of file suffixes (e.g.
.mydata) that are associated with the format.</p>
<p>    DataReader plugin functionality is activated when a data file is
read (e.g. the -f switch) and has one of the format associated suffixes.</p>
<p>    In JSim, DataWriter plugin functionality is activated when a data file
is written (e.g. PlotPage -> Export data file...) that has one of the
format associated suffixes.  In jsbatch, it is activated via the -ofmt
switch, where the format name corresponds to
JSim.data.DataFormat.shortName().  (Note this is not necessarily the same
as the plugin "variant", however it is probably simplest for the two to be
the same.)</p>
<p>    A simple DataFormat plugin example may be found in
$JSIMHOME/doc/plugins/mydata.</p>
<p>    DataFormat implementations in the JSim source code may be found in
classes JSim.data.*Format.</p>

<h2>  <a name="graphic">Graphic plugins</a></h2>
<p>    A Graphic plugin allows customized graphics representation of JSim
model properties, constraints and (possibly live) data.  This client-side
plugin extends the JSim internal class JSim.gui.plugin.GGraphic. </p>
<p>    Graphic plugins are created in the JSim GUI by selected the "New
graphic(plugin)" item in the Project tab "Add" menu.  Project files
store the Graphics tabs,  but do not yet retain any state information.
This limitation will be addressed in future releases.</p>
<p>    A simple Graphic plugin examples may be found in
$JSIMHOME/doc/plugins/mygraphic and $JSIMHOME/doc/plugins/myconstraints. </p>
<p>    There are no implementations of GGraphic in the JSim source code
at this time.</p>

<h2>  <a name="easel">ModelEasel plugins</a></h2>
<p>    This client-side plugin extends the JSim internal class
JSim.gui.plugin.GModelEasel,  providing point-and-click model building
capability within JSim.  </p>
<p>    ModelEasel plugins are created in the JSim GUI by selecting
"New model" in the Project tab "Add" menu.  New models are "text" by
default (users edit MML code directly).  If any ModelEasel plugins are
available,  the user may select one which will result in a new
"Easel" tab within the model.  Users manipulate the Easel graphics
until satified and then hit the "Compile" button which will generate
an MML representation of the graphic and pass it along to the JSim 
compiler.  </p>
<p>    A simple ModelEasel plugin example may be found in
$JSIMHOME/doc/plugins/myeasel.</p>
<p>    There are no implementations if GModelEasel in the JSim source
code at this time.</p>

<h2>  <a name="optim">Optimizer plugins</a></h2>

<p> An Optimizer plugin allows use of novel optimization algorithms not 
currently supported by JSim.  This server-side plugin extends the JSim 
internal class JSim.nml.opt.Optimizer. The plugin class must implement 
the following static method in order to properly advertise itself to 
JSim clients applications:</p>

<pre>
public static OptimAlg.Info algInfo();
</pre>
<p> In the jsim GUI, an Optimizer plugin will appear as an algorithm choice
within a model's optimization configuration tab.  For models containing
non-linear implicit equations, it will also appear in runtime solvers page
"bound" and "unbound" choice options.  In jsbatch, an Optimizer plugin may
be selected via the model.optim.alg control and the solver.fzero_bound and
solver.fzero_unbound parameters.</p>
<p>    A sample Optimizer plugin example may be found in
$JSIMHOME/doc/plugins/myoptimizer.</p>
<p>    Optimizer implementations in the JSim source code may be found
in classes Simplex, GGopt, GridSearch and NelderMead in package 
JSim.nml.opt.</p>

<h2>  <a name="limit">Limitations and Future Plans</a></h2>
<p>    JSim plugin functionality is preliminary, and the mechanisms described
in this document may change in later JSim releases.</p>
<p>    Only two plugin types are currently available.  There will be more
in the future.  If you have an idea for a plugin type that would be 
useful, please contact the JSim development team.</p>
<p>    Plugins are loaded into JSim exclusively via the -plugin switch, which
accepts only a file in the local file system. In the future the -plugin
switch will accept a URL and there will be a mechanism for installing
plugins so they are automatically available to any subsequent JSim
sessions.</p>
<p>    Plugins are not currently operational in the jsserver program.</p>
