<h2>  <a name="start">Starting JSim and loading an example model</a></h2>
<p> JSim may be run by either installing it on your computer, or by
connecting to a JSim enabled WWW site (such as this one).  This
tutorial works for either method.</p>

<h3>To run JSim on your computer</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you have not already done so, <a 
href="../download/index.html">download and install</a> JSim
on your computer.</li>
<li>Start JSim by double-clicking on the jsim icon
(Windows or MacIntosh) or typing "jsim" on the command
line (Linux).</li>
<li><?php jsDown('examples/User/intro1.mod') ?> to your computer. This
is the example model file you'll be using.</li>
<li>Select "Import model file..." from the "Add" menu
under the "Project" tab and select the intro1.mod you
just downloaded.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To run JSim in your browser</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your browser has a Sun-compatible
Java 1.6 plugin installed <a href="User_WWW.html">
(more info)</a></li>
<li><?php jsApp("examples/User/intro1.mod") ?>. You may be asked to OK a 
trust certificate so that the applet can function properly.</li>
</ol>

<h2> <a name="gui">The JSim GUI </a></h2>

<p> Assuming all the above went well, you should now be looking at the
JSim GUI (graphical user interface).  On the GUI left-hand side (LHS)
are tabs labeled "Project" (the table of contents) and "intro1" (the
model you just loaded).  On the right-hand side (RHS) are tabs labeled
"Message" (progress and error messages) and "plotpage_1" (the first of
perhaps multiple plot pages).  In general, the JSim GUI LHS configures
the models and the RHS displays numeric results.</p>

<p>Click on the LHS "intro1" tab.  The model source code should now be
visible (as indicated by the highlighted "Source" tab at the bottom).  
JSim model calculations are usually specified in MML (for Mathematical
Modeling Language, <a href="overview.html">more info</a>), although the <a
href="MML_SBML.html">SBML</a> and <a href="MML_CellML.html">CellML</a>
formats are also supported. This model calculates tracer concentration in
plasma(Cp) and interstitial fluid(Cisf) as driven by an inflow(Cin).  The
code should be fairly easy to comprehend if you are familiar with ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) and note that the colon (:) operator
represents differentiation (e.g. Cp:t means dCp/dt).  The "extern"  
clause in the "Cin" declaration indicates that "Cin" values are supplied
externally by the JSim, rather that within MML.</p>

<h2>  <a name="compile">Compiling the model</a></h2>

<p> Before models can be run, they must be compiled, which means
translating the MML source code into an executable java code.  Do this by
clicking the "Compile" button. Compilation should take a few seconds,
depending upon the speed of your computer.  Compilation checks the
completeness and consistency of model calculations and will abort with an
error message if there is a problem.  There should be no problem here
unless you've inadvertently modified the MML source code or perhaps 
loaded the wrong model.</p>

<h2>  <a name="runtime">Running the model</a></h2>

<p> When a model is successfully compiled, JSim switches from the model
"Source"  subtab to the model "Run Time" subtab, which lets users adjust
parameter values and run the model. The JSim compiler classifies MML
variables as either inputs (settable by the user) or outputs (calculated
during a model run).  JSim "parameters" refer collectively to MML input
variables, numerical solver controls<a href="User_Solvers.html">(more
info)</a> and function generator controls<a href="User_Fgen.html">(more
info)</a>.  User-settable values are displayed with a light-colored
background, immutable values with dark-colored one. Model "domains"  
represent the independent variables of the system(e.g. time & space).  
Here, domain "t" represents time. The sub-variables t.min and t.max
represent the minimum and maximum values of time for a model run.  t.ct
represents the number of points in the time grid, and t.delta represents
the time grid point separation.</p>

<p> A model run is initiated by pressing the "Run" button on the model 
"Run Time" subtab menubar.  If you do that now, an error message will 
tell you that the input variable Cin has not been given a value.  If you 
examine the "Model Inputs" block you can verify this is the case because 
the Cin(t) assignment box is blank.  This is because the MML specified 
Cin as "extern", meaning its value would be assigned by JSim rather than 
within the MML itself.  For this introduction, let's enter a constant 
value for Cin (e.g. 1).  An alternate to a constant value here (as 
elsewhere in JSim) is to use an algebraic expression of model variables. 
However, since this model has "unit conversion on", getting the 
algebraic expression unitarily correct is somewhat tricky, so we'll 
avoid that complication for now (see <a href="MML_Units.html">Using 
Physical Units in MML</a> for details). A second alternative is to 
drive Cin with a function generaton (see <a href="User_Fgen.html">Using 
Function Generators in JSim</a> for details). </p>

<p> Now, press the "Run" button again, wait a few seconds, and a status
message will be printed indicating the model run completed successfully.  
Not much will have changed visually, because we have not set up to plot
any results yet, but if you look carefully you'll notice the output
variables now shows a numeric value from the completed run.  Variables
Cp(t) and Cisf(t) vary over time. The value displayed for them is the one
last calculated.  To view the entire time courses for Cp and Cisf, we will
use JSim plot pages.</p>

<h2>  <a name="plot">Plotting Model Data</a></h2>

<p>    One plot page, named "plotpage_1", is created when you start a new
JSim project.  More can be created, but one will serve for this
introduction. Plot pages appear as tabs on the righthand side of the JSim
project window. Select the plotpage_1 tab to take a look.  The upper
half of a plot page contains the "Plot Configurator" which is a set of
controls for what data will be plotted, and how it will be rendered. The
lower portion of the page is currently blank, but will contain the plot
graphics once we've set up the plot.  To make maximum area available for
graphics, the plot configurator packs a large amount of functionality into
a small screen area.  This currently results in a rather dense and cryptic
arrangement of controls.  NSR continues to work on balancing clarity,
functionality, and space considerations in the plot configurator.</p>

<p> Let's plot some data.  The controls we'll discuss are all on the
second line of the plot configurator, which starts with the label "Data".  
The first box to the right of "Data" shows the source of the data to be
plotted, which can be a model or a data set. Here, since we have a single
model and no data sets, there is only one possibility, so "intro1" is
automatically selected.  In more complex situations, with multiple models
or data sets, you must select the data source manually. The blank box to
the right of intro1 is the data from within intro1 to be plotted.  Let's
type "Cin" (don't type the quote marks) into that box and hit the enter
key.  The box should blacken (indicating that Cin is a valid expression
within model intro1) and a graph of Cin should appear in the formerly
blank graphics area.  If the box does not blacken, double check your
typing.  If the box blackens, but no graph appears, it may be that the
model run was not successfully completed.  In that case, try again
pressing the "Run" button on the intro1 "Run Time" subtab menubar.</p>

<h3> Log and Linear Scaling</h3>
<p>    We now see a plot of Cin versus time, which should look like
exponential decay.  We can verify it is, in fact, exponential decay by
checking the "Log" checkbox which will set log scaling on the Y axis.  
With log scaling on, Cin should appear as a straight line.  Now uncheck
the "Log" checkbox so that Cin appears as a curve under linear scaling.</p>

<h3> Selecting Data to Plot</h3>
<p>    The interesting variables in intro1 are the outputs Cp and Cisf.  You
can display them by either typing them into the data selection box that
currently holds Cin, or selecting them from the menu that is attached to
the down arrow button to the right of the data selection box. 
You may also type algebraic expressions into the data
selection box.  In intro1, Cp+Cisf, Cp-Cisf, 0.5*Cin might be 
interesting possibilities.</p>

<h3>  Plotting Multiple Data Curves</h3>
<p>    It is often useful to see multiple data curves on a single plot.  
Let's plot Cp and Cisf.  First, use what you've learned to get plain old Cp
onto the current plot.  To add a 2nd curve to the plot, click the button
to the right of the label "Curve" and select "2" from the menu that pops
up.  The 2nd (and 3rd) lines of the plot configurator now reflect the
second, rather than the first curve.  We can specify what we'd like to see
in the second curve just as we did in the first: by selecting Cisf in the
data selection box.  Now both Cp and Cisf should appear on your plot page.
You can adjust the color, symbol, and line rendering characteristics
for each curve with the 5 right-most controls on line 3. For instance,
clicking on the solid colored button popups up a color menu.</p>

<h2> <a name="save">Saving your work</a></h2>

<p> At this point, we'll save our work.  A JSim project file saves the
complete state of a JSim GUI window so it can be reestablished in a
single operation at a later time.  To do this, activate the "Project" tab
on the GUI LHS.  Select the "Save" option
from the "File" menu there.  A standard file selection popup will appear
allowing you to name your project file and save it in the directory of
your choice.  The suffix ".proj" will be automatically appended to the
file name.  If you select a directory that you don't have write permission
for, an error message will alert you to this fact.  In that case, you'll
need to find a directory you do have write permission for.  A message at
the bottom of the project window will indicate a successful save.  
Remember the location and name of the project file you've saved.</p>
<p>JSim (version 2.19 and greater) also allows you to automatically save 
the project file associated with the last successfully run simulation, 
optimization, loops run, and sensitivity analysis. This backup can be useful when 
working on a very complicated model and for whatever reason the model stops 
working or JSim crashes unexpectedly during a long simulation. The backup file 
will be called "ModelName_LastRun.proj", where "ModelName" was the original 
project file name. To enable this feature go to the "Preferences" drop down 
menu of the "Project" tab. Choose "Auto backup project file" and chose "Yes". 
To make this change permanent, go back to the "Preferences" drop down menu 
and chose "Save preferences" at the bottom. This will save your preferences 
locally in the .jsim/local/preferences.xml file.
</p>

<h3> Reloading a project file </h2>

<p>We'll now exit JSim and reload the project file you just created.</p>

<p> <strong>If you're running JSim on your own computer</strong>: select  "Exit 
program" from the Project tab's "File" menu, and then restart JSim.  
Under the Project tab's File menu, select "Open project file".  A file
selection box will appear in which you should select the project file you
just created.  A new Project will open containing the project you just
created.  JSim allows multiple projects to be open at one time and allows
you to paste content between the projects in a natural way. That is not
covered in this introduction, however.</p>

<p> <strong>If you're using the JSim applet</strong>: exit the applet by closing the
window or tab in which it is running.  You won't be able to restore your own
personal work unless you install JSim on your own computer (see above).
However, you can run the applet a demonstration project file instead.  
<?php jsApp("examples/User/intro1.proj") ?> </p>

<p> The 
reloaded project should contain an intro1 model tab. Clicking on
this tab, you will see that the project load has reestabished the model
source code, the compile state, and the assigned value of Cin.  It does
not reestablish the intro1 model run because, for large models, this might
be unnecessary and very time consuming.  In our case, the model run is
quick, so click the Run button and check that the model run has completed
(do you remember how?  hint: Cp(t)).  Clicking on the plotpage_1 tab, you
should now see the plot page data and rendering in the same state you left
it when you saved the project file.</p>
