<h1>Using Templates in MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<p> This document discusses the current state of templates in MML.  MML
templates allow an MML author to create reusable modules which become
valuable in large-scale modeling.  JSim template implementation is still
in an experimental stage, and the information provided here may well
change for future releases of JSim.</p>

<h2> <a name="flat">Understanding components and
flattening</a></h2> 

<p> MML models are constructed via nested components.  Each component
may contains one or more sub-components and/or constraints. The most
common form for constraints are equations, but constraints also
include <a href="MML_Events.html">events</a> and <a
href="MML_Func_Intro.html">procedures</a> .  Consider the following
model:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Templates/expdecay.mod"); ?>

<p>    The top level component (of type math) is called main.  main contains
2 sub-components:  t (of type realDomain), and u (of type real) and 5
equation constraints. The t component contains 4 sub-components: min,
max and delta (of type real) and ct (of type int).</p>
<p>    Most JSim modelers use only the predefined JSim types (math, real,
realDomain, realState, int, intState, choice).  However, JSim allows users
to define their own types via the "template" declaration.  When the JSim
compiler encounters a component declaration for a user-defined template,
the component goes through a "flattening" process wherein the component is
reduced to predefined JSim types.  Once the entire model is "flat", the
compiler proceeds to generate run-time code, dealing only within
pre-defined types.  This approach spares the component writer the arduous
task of understanding the internals of the JSim compiler,  thus making
template writing a fairly straight-forward process.</p>
<h2>  <a name="mfax">Understanding the MFAX and XSIM template packages</a></h2>
<p>    NSR currently distributes two optional template packages with JSim:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="MML_MFAX_Intro.html">MFAX</a> : a set of templates appropriate for 
chemical network models in multiple compartments with convective flow and 
membrane transport between those compartments.  MFAX is an example
of a "Biological Component Library" (BCL) because each template is 
intended to represent an abstract biochemical entity (e.g. compartment, 
chemical species, chemical reaction, ...).</li>
<li><a href="MML_XSim_Intro.html">XSIM</a> : a set of templates appopriate for
running XSIM-style models under JSim.  These templates do not constitute
a BCL is the classic sense,  since none of them represent biological 
components,  but the underlying implementation methodology is identical
to that of the MFAX BCL.</li>

</ul>
<p>    In each case, the model writer imports the set of template definitions
via the MML "import" directive, and creates of model by declaring
components using some combination of the these templates and JSim's
default templates.  Consider the following MFAX model, which describes a
the dimerization of a chemical species A in a single compartment:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Templates/mfax01.mod"); ?>

<p> The top level component here is named "main", and is of type MFAX.
example1 has 5 sub-components: t (of type Time); A and B (of type
Chem); C (of type Compartment); and R (of type MassBalReaction).  
example1 also contains 6 equation constraints (e.g. "R.kb = 0.5"). The
new types were defined via template commands in the imported MFAX.mod
file, a portion of which is show below: </p>

<pre>
class template MFAX { class="JSim.bcl.mfax.MFSys"; }
class template Time { class="JSim.bcl.mfax.Time"; }
class template Chem { class="JSim.bcl.mfax.Chem"; }
class template Membrane { class="JSim.bcl.mfax.Membrane"; }
</pre>

<p>    The details of these template declarations is explored in the
following sections.</p>

<h2>  <a name="templ">Template Declarations</a></h2>
<p>    There are currently two types of template declarations supported by
MML - class templates and MML templates.  Class templates are described by
pre-compiled java classes that are loaded as needed.  MML templates are
templates described in MML.  Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, as
described in the following sections.  Overall, class templates are more
general and powerful while MML templates are more transparent and easier
to create and maintain.  Both the MFAX and XSIM template packages are
implemented using class templates.  It is expected that MML templates will
eventually play an important role in creating large modular physiological
models.</p>
<p>    A template declaration doesn't "do anything" by itself, that only
happens when one or more components are declared using the template.  
Each component inherits properties of its template and the model writer
may extend them in various template-specific ways.  The component
declaration syntax is independent of the template declaration methodology,
facilitating easy reuse and/or substitution of templates.</p>
<h2>  <a name="class">Class Templates</a></h2>
<p>    Class templates have form:</p>
<pre>
class template NAME { class="CLASSNAME"; }
</pre>

<p>    where words in lower case are reserved by MML, and capitals are
defined by the model writer. See the <a href="#mfax">MFAX/XSIM section</a> above for a
specific example.  CLASSNAME refers to a Java class accessible to JSim via
<a href="User_Ref.html#env">JSIMPATH</a> that follows appropriate conventions for
interacting with the planner.  Unfortunately, those conventions are not
yet finalized and documented, which means that, at present, class
templates are only an option for model writers to get the 
<a href="../download/source.html">JSim
source code</a> .</p>
<h2>  <a name="mml">MML Templates</a></h2>
<p>    MML templates allow you to extend existing templates via MML.  The
simplest usage would be to extend the built-in math template, which
represents a collection of variables and/or constraints.  For 
example:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Templates/template2.mod"); ?>

<p>    Here the template ABC defines 3 real variables (a, b and c) and one
constraint (a+b=c).  The top-level model component "main" defines two
sub-components X and Y, each of type ABC, meaning that each contains the
sub-variables a, b, and c and the a+b=c constraint on those variables.
Since the internal ABC constraints leave 2 of it's 3 variables
unconstrained, additional constraints must be placed in the top-level
component for the model to compile sucessfully.  In this case, by
constraining X.a and X.b, X.c can be calculated.  Y.b is set to 5, and
"Y.c=X.c" ends up calculating Y.c, since X.c had already been constrained.  
The Y version of the a+b=c constraint end up calculating Y.a, since Y.b
and Y.c have already been constrained. Note that template constraints do
not necessarily determine order of calculation within the component, but
that the order may be determined by contextual usage.  This is an
important feature for writing widely reusable components.</p>
<p>    An existing template can be extended following this example, in which
the ABC template is extended to include another variable and another 
constraint:</p>

<?php jsTextDownApp("examples/MML_Templates/template3.mod"); ?>

<p>    Note that substitution of the ABCD template for ABC in the main 
component resulted in only minor changes within main itself.  In this
way,  it is hoped templates can introduce a degree of modular construction
necessary for large-scale modeling.  </p>
<h2>  <a name="limits">Limitations of MML Templates</a></h2>
<p>    While MML templates do have some existing functionality within JSim,
they are not yet fully supported and/or documented because the following
unresolved problem which are judged to be serious enough to hamper
real-world professional usage.  It is quite possible that resolution of
these problems will require changes to template syntax, which would be
problematic for on-going support if this feature was prematurely released:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mechanisms for sharing common variables between components are not
yet well defined, yet they are critical to real-world usage.  In
particular, template-defined variables must be aware of realDomains (e.g.
time) which, to be meaningful, must be shared.  The preliminary sharing
mechanisms currently in place are currently judged to be insufficient for
real-world usage and so are not documented here, lest we become too
attached to them.</li>
<li>Effective large-scale use of MML templates requires importing
declarations from multiple source files.  The JSim GUI does not yet
support editing or project-based control of multiple sources for a single
model.  Thus, imported files must be stored separately either a user's
directory or the JSim installation, which is currently awkward, especially
for new users.  Better mechanisms for sharing importable templates
(perhaps network based) must be developed.</li>
<li>MML extension of variable templates (e.g. real, realDomain, ...)
is sub-optimal because there is no syntax supporting constaint of
its own value (i.e. "this").</li>
<li>MML extension of class templates is not yet supported, and 
vice-versa.</li>
<li>Template declaration syntax currently implies single-inheritance,
which may or may not be a critical problem.  There is yet no general 
consensus as to whether multiple-inheritance is an essential feature
for object-oriented programming (C++ has it,  Java does not).</li>
