<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p> This document gives describes how to write and serve JSim-enabled Web 
pages which allow you to demonstrate JSim, or particular models, to the 
public. This document assumes you are familiar with HTML, Web server 
administration and <a href="Admin_Server.html">JSim remote server 
administration</a> .</p>

<h2>  <a name="trust">Trusted and Untrusted Applets</a></h2>
<p>    JSim can run as a java applet within an HTML Web page.  It may operate
in either trusted or untrusted mode. In either mode, the JSim applet can
load demonstration projects, run models and plot results.  However, when
operating in untrusted mode the applet may not:</p>

<ul>
<li>read or write files <strong>in the user's local file system</strong>.  In
JSim's case, this means loading or saving project, model, data and
preferences files.  (However, demostration project, model and data files
can be loaded at program launch from accessible Web sites.)</li>
<li>establish network connections any host other than the one that
serves the applet jar file (JSimClient.jar).  In JSim's case, this affects
the JSim remote server connection and any files loaded on the command
line.</li>

</ul>
<p>    When an untrusted applet attempts an unpermitted operation, an error
message will be generated, and the program will exit or continue as is
appropriate.</p>
<p>    Establishing an applet as trusted is a complex subject,  and 
will not be dealt with here in great detail.  The method used at 
the NSR website to establish trust is described at the <a href="#nsr">end of this
document</a> .</p>
<h2>  <a name="server">Remote Model Computation</a></h2>
<p>    Since JSim's numerical library relies on native libraries, which are
not allowed in applets (trusted or not), JSim applets perform model
calculations on a host running the <a href="Admin_Server.html">JSim server</a> .  
Untrusted applet network connections are restricted to the host that
serves the applet jar file (JSimClient.jar), meaning a JSim server must be
running there.  Trusted applets may connect to any network host (see the
-server switch below).</p>
<h2>  <a name="html">HTML Usage</a></h2>
<p>    A comprehensive HTML and WWW server administration tutorial is 
beyond the scope of this document,  which offers only a few simple
examples of JSim applet usage within HTML.  HTML authors interested
in the JSim applet should consult HTML standard documentation for 
complete details and work with their local WWW server administrator.</p>
<p>    An JSim applet is embedded in HTML via the object or applet tags
using the java archive JSIMHOME/lib/JSimClient.jar from your JSim 
distribution.  For example:
<pre>
      &lt;object
        type="application/x-java-applet"
        classid="java:JSim.gui.GLaunch"
        archive="JSimClient.jar"
        width="1000"
        height="600"
        args="-f demo.proj"
      &gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>    or alternatively:
<pre>
      &lt;applet
        code="JSim.gui.GLaunch"
        archive="JSimClient.jar"
        width="1000"
        height="600"
      &gt;
      &lt;param name=args value="-f demo.proj"&gt;
      &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>    These examples assume the file demo.proj is served (via HTTP) from
the same directory as JSimClient.jar.</p>
<p>    All the normal <a href="User_Ref.html#switch">command-line switches</a> are
available via the <strong>args</strong> tag above,  however some switches have 
slightly altered meanings in the applet context:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>-f</strong> refers not to files in the client's local file system, but
to files served via HTTP. The default directory for these files is the
host and directory from the calling URL (e.g. an HTML file).  Applets may
override the directory via the <strong>-userurl</strong> switch.  An untrusted
applet will generate an error if <strong>-userurl</strong> is not on the same host
from which JSimClient.jar is served.</li>
<li><strong>-server</strong> defaults to the host from which JSimClient.jar is 
served.  The other connect parameters (user name, 
port and server name) take on default values.  An untrusted applet
will generate an error if <strong>-server</strong> is not on the same host 
from which JSimClient.jar is served.</li>

</ul>
<p>    <strong>Note for advanced administrators:</strong> It has been noted that
untrusted applets may have permission difficulties accessing a JSim server
on a computer with multiple IP addresses, depending on how the host OS
directs traffic between those addresses. In such cases, the applet/object
codebase attribute and the -server and -userurl JSim switches may need to
all point to the primary IP address of the server.</p>
<h2>  <a name="browser">Browser Requirements</a></h2>
<p>    The JSim applet requires the user's browser have a Sun Java 1.6 
compatible plug-in installed.  See <a href="User_WWW.html">Running JSim inside a Web 
Browser</a> for complete information.</p>
<h2>  <a name="nsr">Applet Trust Implementation at NSR</a></h2>
<p>    On the NSR web site, various pages use the JSim applet in both 
trusted and untrusted mode.  Those that use trusted mode,  implement
trust via a signed jar file.  Sun's keytool and jarsigner programs
are used to digitally sign JSimClient.jar.  For example:
<pre>
      keytool -genkey -alias JSimApplet

      jarsigner JSimClient.jar JSimApplet
</pre>
</p>
<p>    When the signed jar file is downloaded by a Java 2 compliant browser,
the user is presented with a dialog box asking if s/he wishes to trust the
applet.  If s/he agrees, the applet will run in trusted mode.  If not, the
applet will run in untrusted mode.</p>
<p>    Please note that the JSimClient.jar distributed with JSim is not
signed.  If you wish to follow NSR's trust scheme at your web-site, you
will need to sign the jar file locally.</p>
<p>    Applet security is a very complex topic and there are numerous
alternative approaches to the one taken at NSR.  It is possible that we
will change or refine our approach in the future to meet new security 
concerns.</p>
