<h1>Calling Matlab Code from MML</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This document describes the process of calling Matlab computations 
within MML models.  This is one of several ways to connect JSim and 
Matlab.  For an overview of possible JSim/Matlab connection 
strategies, see <a href="MML_Matlab.html">Connecting JSim and 
Matlab</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p>Although, <a href="#future">in the future</a>, model writers will be 
able to write Matlab commands directly in MML, for the present, you must 
connect to Matlab via <a href="MML_Func_Java.html">Java</a> or <a 
href="MML_Func_C.html">C</a> (follow links for details on each 
language).  Using either language you may call Matlab via the command 
line or an available Matlab API.  Calling Matlab via the command line is 
simple and robust, but the overhead of loading Matlab for each function 
or procedure call may result in inadequate performance, depending upon 
the nature of the problem at hand.  Calling Matlab via a Java or C API 
requires more technical expertise, but is potentially much higher 
performance, again depending upon the problem.</p>

<h2><a name="command">Calling Matlab via the command line</a></h2>

<p>In this scenario, an MML function or procedure creates or 
modifies one or more Matlab .m files,  launches Matlab to run the
.m file command which writes an appropriate output file,  then
reads the output file back,  and returns the results to the JSim model.
Since there is signficant overhead in starting Matlab,  this approach
is only well suited to problems in which the number of Matlab calls 
is limited or the computation time for each Matlab call in large in
comparison to the Matlab load time.

<h3><a name="example_jdet">Example: Determinant calculated via Java 
Function and Matlab</a></h3>

<p>In this example model, a Java function runs the Matlab application to 
calculate the determinant v of a random square matrix u.</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Matlab/jdet.mod"); ?>

<h3><a name="example_jinv">Example: Matrix inversion calculated via Java 
Procedure and Matlab</a></h3>

<p>In this example model, a Java procedure runs the Matlab application 
to calculate the inverse v of a random square matrix u.</p>

<?php jsTextDown("examples/MML_Matlab/jinv.mod"); ?>

<h3><a name="example_react4">Example: 4 solute reaction network, steady 
state calculated via Java procedure Matlab</a></h3>

<p>In this example, 4 solutes (A,B,C,D) react in a mixing chamber.  JSim 
calculates the time-series solution via standard ODEs.  JSim also passes 
the stoichiometry matrix to Matlab, for calculation of the steady-state 
solution(Af, Bf, Cf, Df).</p>

<?php jsDown("examples/MML_Matlab/react4matlab.proj"); ?>
</p>

<p> JSim model without matlab (for comparison): 
<?php jsDown("examples/MML_Matlab/react4.proj"); ?>
</p>


<h2><a name="api">Calling Matlab via an API</a></h2>

<p>Using an API to control to Matlab allow the model writer to
start the Matlab engine only once, rather than multiple times.
Depending upon the problem,  this approach can save a significant
amount of computation time,  usually at the cost of more complex
control code.</p>

<p>Matlab provides a variety of APIs for connecting to external 
software.  A complete description of Matlab's APIs is beyond the scope 
of this document, but see, for example: "Mastering Matlab 7" by 
Hanselman and Littlefield, chapter 34.  In addition, various third 
parties have provided Matlab connectivity products.  Again, a complete 
review of such products is beyond the scope of this document. This 
document will demonstrate one possible API for controlling Matlab from 
JSim: the Matlab Engine C API.</p>

<h3>The Matlab Engine C API</h3>

<p>This API is supported by Mathworks,  and so should be fairly stable.
Connecting via C poses the standard portability problems mentioned 
in <a href="MML_Func_C.html">Calling C Code From MML</a>,  including
the inability to run in applets and the difficulties of distributing
such models to non-expert users.</p>

<h4>Example of calling Matlab Engine C API from MML</h4>

<p><em>This example is under construction.</em></p>

<h2><a name="future">Future plans</a></h2>

<p>In the future, JSim will support writing Matlab commands directly 
within MML functions and procedures.  When this feature is available, it 
will make the process of calling Matlab efficiently from MML 
considerably simpler that it is currently.  The text below is a mockup 
of what Matlab F&P might look like.  In this example,  the Matlab 
procedure <em>reverse()</em> reverses the elements in the 
provided 1-dimensional array.</p>

<pre>
source procedure reverse(u@t; v@t) {
        language = "matlab";
        maincode={{
            % u and t automatically generated
            N = length(u)
            v = u( N:(-1):1 )
        }};
}

math main {
        realDomain t;
        t.min=0; t.max=4; t.delta=1;
        real u(t) = t^2;
        real v(t);
        reverse(u@t, v@t);
}
</pre>
