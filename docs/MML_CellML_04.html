<h1>Running CellML Models under JSim - For JSim Versions 2.00 
to 2.04</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>


<p> CellML is an XML based open standard for exchange of computer based
mathematical models.  JSim currently support importing most CellML models.  
Extended import and export support is currently under development.</p>

<h2>  <a name="imp">Importing CellML Files into JSim</a></h2>
<p>    Assuming no tranlation problems, importing CellML into JSim is quite
easy.  Select "Import model file" from the "Add" menu under the JSim
GUI's "Project" tab, which allows you to select a model file to import.  
CellML files have extension .xml or .cellml.  (Note that .xml is used by 
many
XML-based files besides CellML, so be sure to pick a real CellML file).  
Alternatively, you can load a CellML file via the -f switch on the command
line of either jsim or jsbatch.</p>
<p>    If translation is successful, a new model tab will appear in the
project containing the translated MML source code.  If the translator
has a problem, an appropriate error message will be generated.  No partial
translation will appear in the event of a translation error.  Errors at
this stage are most likely because the translator implementation is still
incomplete (see <a href="#bugs">Bugs and Limitations</a> below).</p>
<p>    Now push the "Compile" button to compile the model.  There is no
guarantee that the code will compile successfully since CellML models are
subject to the same sorts of formulation errors MML models are.  Errors at
this stage are most often caused by specification errors in the original
CellML file. Two problems often seen at compile time are:</p>

<ol>
<li> Model variables may be over-constrained or under-constrained by the
model equations.  Both result in compilation errors but, in the
under-constrained case, the compiler may take a long time before exiting.
The compile "Cancel" button is useful here since most well-constrained
models will compile in 15 seconds or less.</li>
<li> Model equations may not be unit balanced.  CellML models assume
units are balanced, however it is our experience that many of the models
available in the CellML repository are not.  It is possible the failure to
compile these models relates to problems in JSim's CellML translator.  
Investigation continues on this issue.  JSim's <a 
href="/jsim/models/cellml">CellML Models Page</a> provides MML versions of
CellML models with unit correction turned off when turning unit correction
on results in a compilation error.</li>

</ol>
<p>    CellML to MML translation on the command line may be accomplished
using jsbatch:
<pre>
      jsbatch -f somemodel.xml -omml &gt; somemodel.mod
</pre>
</p>

<p>At run-time users should be advised that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time stepping parameters are not defined in CellML files, and must
be entered by the user.</li>
<li>Many CellML archive models do not have valid initial conditions.  The
user may need to specify some initial conditions manually to get 
reasonable output data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>  <a name="stat">Project Status</a></h2>
<p>    JSim's CellML translator is far from complete and should be viewed as
a first stage toward a complete and robust translator.  It was developed
based the CellML 1.1 specification with the intent of providing adequate
translation for most of the models in the CellML repository.  As of 11 Jun
2005, of the 329 models used as a test bed, approximately 85% translated
to MML without error.  Very few of those translated models compile
sucessfully under JSim however, mostly due to equations with unbalanced
units.  Only about 5% of the translated models had compilation problems
beyond unit balancing.</p>
<h2>  <a name="bugs">Bugs and Limitations</a></h2>
<p>    The following bugs are based on experience with the 329 model test bed
(see above).  No systematic description of bugs beyond that test bed is
yet available.</p>
<p>    The following CellML tags are not yet supported:
<pre>
      &lt;partialdiff&gt;
      &lt;degree&gt;
      &lt;import&gt;
      &lt;sum&gt;
      &lt;domainofapplication&gt;
      &lt;lowlimit&gt;
      &lt;uplimit&gt;
      &lt;piecewise&gt; without &lt;otherwise&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>    Celsius units are not supported.  This will require currently
unavailable contextual information allowing differentiation between
absolute and relative units.</p>
<p>    Mapping of CellML variable names to JSim variable names is
sub-optimal.  CellML names are currently translated as the
component-name.variable-name unless variable-name is unique within all
components, in which case the component-name is dropped. CellML component
and variable names are often long (over 50 characters) which, due to
limited screen real estate, makes their display in the JSim GUI awkward
for the user.  Computationally however, JSim has no particular problems
with long names.  Preliminary users of the CellML translator may wish to
suggest ideas for better translation algorithms to the JSim development
team for implementation in later releases.</p>
<p>    The translator does not treat the left and right hand sides of
equations the same.  A non-ODE variable missing the "initial_value"
attribute and not appearing on the left-hand side of any equation is
assumed to be unconstrained, and is therefore translated as an "extern" in
MML.  This assumption is not supported by the CellML specification (as far
as I know), but is necessary for the bulk of the test bed models to
compile successfully (excepting unit balancing issues).</p>
<p>    CellML does not specify variable domains directly, but implies them
from model equations.  The translator assigns variables the minimum number
of domains consistent with the equations.  In some cases, users may need
to manually add domains to some translated MML variables to produce
satisfactory results.  Currently, variables are translated as domains if
they appear in the denominator of a derivative operator.  A variable V is
assigned a domain X if V appears in the numerator of a derivative operator
of X or if V appears isolated in the left-hand side of an equation whose
right-hand side includes a variable with domain X.  As in the previous
paragraph, this approach is not supported by the CellML specification, but
is needed for satisfactory translation.</p>
<p>    No attempt is currently made to import CellML model diagrams or
metadata.</p>
<p>    JSim does not provide any MML to CellML translator at this time.    </p>
<h2>  <a name="auck">University of Auckland Collaboration</a></h2>
<h3>    Overview </h3>
<p>      This section is devoted to the collaborative effort between NSR and
the University of Auckland (UA) to clean up unit conversion problems in
the CellML repository models and refine JSim's CellML translator.</p>
<p>      This will be an iterative process.  NSR will provide UA with a
recommended release of JSim for testing along with a list of models within
the repository which JSim can translate successfully, excluding unit
balancing errors.  This version may be the latest experimental (beta)
release, or it may be a more preliminary alpha release.  UA will use this
version of JSim to generate MML unit balancing error messages and correct
the repository models.  If UA finds problems in the translator itself (as
opposed to the CellML code), they will relay them back to NSR.  NSR will
attempt to fix the problem and provide a new recommended JSim version for
further testing.  We'll repeat this process until all unit problems are
resolved.</p>

<h3>    Suggested approach</h3>

<ol>
<li> Run "jsbatch -v -oplan -f somemodel.xml". If this command
completes successfully, it will print a description of the run-time
calculations. If it fails, a list of unit balancing errors (maximum one
per equation) will be sent to stderr.</li>
<li> If the model fails, use "jsbatch -omml -f somemodel.xml >
somemodel.mod" to print out translated model text.  Use the embedded
comments to trace back offending equations to the original CellML.</li>

</ol>
