<h2>  <a name="underXSim">Basics of XSim-style models under XSim</a></h2>
<p>    XSim is a simulation control interface for Unix systems developed at
NSR.  Models running under XSim consist of two principle components: 
computational model code and a configuration file (.cf).</p>
<p>    The model code, usually written in Fortran, must conform to the
XSim API (application programmer interface) and is compiled with a set of
XSim specific wrappers.  In brief, the XSim API states that model
parameters are stored in a single-precision floating point array called
the P array.  Model calculations are divided into an initialization
subroutine (simini) which is called once at the beginning of a run, a loop
subroutine (simlop) which is called once for each model time-step during
the run, and completion subroutine (simend) which is called once at the
end of the run.  With minor exceptions, all communication between the GUI
and the model is done through the P array.</p>
<p>    The configuration file is a data file that contains the parameter
names the XSim user will associate with various P array locations.  It
also describes the model appearance to the user in terms of windows,
parameter boxes, buttons, text and images.  It also contains the name of
the computational model code, so the two can be conjoined.</p>
<h2>  <a name="underJSim">Basics of XSim-style models under JSim</a></h2>
<p>    JSim provides mechanisms that allow running XSim-style models under
JSim.  Existing XSim models must be recompiled and appropriately wrapped
before use under JSim.  An XSim-style model for JSim consists of two
principal components: computational model code and an MML wrapper.</p>
<p>    The computational model code is a free-standing native code library that
conforms to the XSim API (Application Program Interface) for JSim.  The XSim
API for JSim distills the essence of historical Simcon/XSim programs, i.e.
model-GUI communication via a floating point P array and model
initialization, loop and completion subroutines.  Most existing XSim-style
computational models are written in Fortran, so JSim provides tools to
automatically wrap compiled Fortran code that conforms to the XSim API.  
This can be accomplished by Fortran programmers with no knowledge of Java.  
A C language wrapper facility will also be supported in the near future.</p>
<p>    The MML wrapper is an MML model that utilizes the importable "XSim" 
template library.  A simple example is shown below:
<pre>
        import XSim;
        XSim main {
          library lib("demo");
          ivar time;    
          time.min=0; time.max=30; time.delta=0.1; time.loc = 130;
          realInput period = 6; period.loc = 1;
          realInput amplitude = 1; amplitude.loc = 2;
          realOutput Sine(time); Sine.loc = 201;
          realOutput Cosine(time); Cosine.loc = 202;
       }
</pre>
</p>
<p>    The MML wrapper declares model parameters and their locations in the P
array.  It also names the computational model ("demo") so the two can be
conjoined.  In these two respects, an MML wrapper is similar to an XSim
configuration file.  Unlike the .cf file, the MML wrapper does not describe
the appearance of the model.  JSim provides a default run-time appearance
(e.g. Inputs and Outputs pages) that requires no user intervention.  
Customization of JSim's run-time appearance is handled in a model's
customization tab using JSim's Run-Time Markup Language (RTML). See
<a href="MML_RTML_Ref.html">here</a> For further infomation on model customization and
RTML.</p>
<h2>  <a name="building">Building XSim-style models for JSim</a></h2>
<p>    To build an XSim-style model for use under JSim you must create the
two components described in the previous section:  the computational model
code and the MML wrapper.  Note that the complete file name for the
computational model is system dependent.  In the "demo" example above, the
file name would be libjsxdemo.so under Linux and libjsxdemo.jnilib under
MacOS.  XSim-style models are not yet available on Windows.</p>
<p>    The computational model code may be programmed in C or Fortran. The
process varies depending upon the language used.  See the guide below
appropriate for your language of preference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="MML_XSim_Fortran.html">Writing XSim-style models for JSim in Fortran</a></li>
<li><a href="MML_XSim_C.html">Writing XSim-style models for JSim in C</a></li>

</ul>
<p>    The MML wrapper uses the importable XSim template library:</p>

<li><a href="MML_XSim_Templates.html">The XSim template library for JSim</a></li>

</ul>
<p>    Once the two pieces are created,  you may try your luck at 
running them under JSim.  See the next section.</p>
<h2>  <a name="running">Running XSim-style models under JSim</a></h2>
<p>    To run an XSim-style model under JSim, you simply load the .mod or
.proj file containing the MML wrapper (see above) into JSim, compile and
run as usual.  </p>
<p>    The only complication is that the free-standing computation model code
must be somewhere in <a href="User_Ref.html#env">JSIMPATH</a> .  This complication is
necessary because the free-standing code is not stored in the project file
itself.  The reasons for this are:</p>
<p>    1) free-standing model code contains native object code which is not
portable between operating systems, perhaps even between different versions
of the same operating system.</p>
<p>    2) code files are often quite large and would present unacceptable
storage requirements if they were copied to many project files on the same
system.</p>
<p>    In practice, the default JSIMPATH is usually sufficient.  Model
writers should make sure their free-standing code is in the current
directory while they are working on it.  Once the model is read for
general use it may be placed in either the system's local configuration
directory $JSIMHOME/local or the user's local configuration directory
$HOME/.jsim/local.  All of these directories are in the default JSIMPATH.</p>
<h2>  <a name="caveats">Some Caveats</a></h2>
<p>    Here are some cautions to bear in mind regarding XSim-style models
under JSim:</p>

<ul>
<li>See comments regarding JSIMPATH in the previous section.</li>
<li>If you are sharing a new model with a collaborator, shipping him the
project file is not enough.  He must also get a working copy of the
free-standing model computation code.  If he is using the same operating
system version you are you can ship him your copy of the code.  If he is
using a different operating system version, he must build or otherwise
obtain a copy of the code appropriate to his system.</li>
<li>Native code libraries are inherently insecure.  They can (potentially)
steal information, delete files, or otherwise corrupt your account.  On
Microsoft Windows, they can also corrupt your operating system and/or damage
your hardware.  Bugs in even well-intentioned code can corrupt run-time
memory crashing not only the model, but the JSim interface as well. You
should only run native libraries that come from a trusted source.</li>
<li>Tools for automated conversion of existing XSim models into
JSim-compatible versions are in progess, but not yet completed. </li>
<li>XSim templates for JSim do not yet offer functionality equivalent
to XSim STRING variables.</li>
<li>RTML does not yet offer equivalents to all the front-end 
customizations available in XSim.  RTML is not yet documented.</li>

</ul>
