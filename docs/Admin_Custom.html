<h1>Customizing a JSim Installation</h1>

<?php include "topmsg.php"; ?>

<p>  This document discusses various customizations you may wish to to a JSim
installation.  It assumes you have successfully installed JSim on your
system and are familiar with <a href="User_Ref.html#env">JSIM Environment Variables</a> 
.</p>

<p>  The various customization options described here require either
modifying user environment variables or installing scripts within
JSIMPATH so that they can be found at run-time.  Environmental variable
customization is typically done at login time, and may affect single users
or all users.  See your system's documentation on how this is done.</p>

<p>  When scripts must be placed in JSIMPATH,  this is typically done in 
JSIMHOME/local for system-wide customization,  or HOME/.jsim/local for
user-specific customizations.  Both these directories are in the default
JSIMPATH.</p>

<h2>  Customization topics:</h2>

<p>    <a href="#finder">MacOS finder behavior</a></p>

<p>    <a href="#secure">Security issues in customization</a></p>

<p>    <a href="#c">Setting up a C compiler for use with JSim</a></p>

<p>    <a href="#cplus">Setting up a C++ compiler for use with JSim</a></p>

<p>    <a href="#fortran">Setting up a Fortran compiler for use with JSim</a></p>

<p>    <a href="#matlab">Setting up Matlab for use with JSim</a></p>

<p>  Note that a Java compiler is distributed with JSim,  so no customization
is required for MML models that contain functions or procedures in Java.</p>

<h2>  <a name="finder">Mac OS Finder Behavior</a></h2>

<p>On the Macintosh, data files can be opened in the Finder by 
double-clicking. By default, .jsml, .tac, .csv, .cdata and .bul files 
will open in JSim. This behavior can be changed on an individual file 
basis or for a particular user on a particular Mac. For example, if you 
want all .tac files to open with TextEdit, do the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>Select any .tac file in the Finder.</li>

<li>Select "Get Info" from the File menu.</li>

<li>In the pulldown menu labeled "Open with:", select "TextEdit". 
Then skip to step 7 below.</li>

<li>If "TextEdit" does not appear, select "Other..."</li>

<li>Navigate to "TextEdit" (it will be found in the Applications 
folder).</li>

<li>Click on "Add".</li>

<li>Click on "Change All...".</li>

<li>Click on "Continue".</li>

</ol>


<h2>  <a name="secure">Security issues is customization</a></h2>

<p>    Before doing any local JSim customization, make sure you understand
basic <a href="User_Sandbox.html">the JSim Sandbox</a> .  Never place untrusted
files in either JSIMHOME/local or HOME/.jsim/local.  Such files can be
accessed via JSim models <strong>EVEN IN THE SANDBOX</strong>, possibly resulting in
a compromised system.</p>

<h2>  <a name="c">Setting up a C compiler for use with JSim</a></h2>

<p>    MML models may contain functions or procedures that require a C compiler.  See
<a href="MML_Func_C.html">Calling C Code From MML</a> for details.   JSim does not
contain an internal C compiler, but calls a local script for that purpose.  The
script is named jscompile_c (formerly jscompile_c.sh)   for Linux and MacIntosh, and
jscompile_c.bat for Windows.  A default version of jscompile_c(.bat) is provided in
$JSIMHOME/local for all  distribution. This is a shell script uses the makefiles in
$JSIMHOME/lib.   Administrators will normally need to modify those makefiles to
reflect compiler locations on their local systems.  gcc version 4 is assumed,  the
Cygwin version in the Windows distribution.  You will need to edit jscompile_c(.bat)
and/or the relevant Makefiles for it to work properly on your system.  Instructions
for installing compilers and modifying makefiles is beyond the scope of the JSim
documentation set.  Consult an expert system administrator if required. Users may
override the $JSIMHOME/local compile script by placing one somewhere in JSIMPATH.</p>

<p>    The calling arguments for jscompile_c and jscompile_c.bat are:</p>

<ol>
<li> JSIMHOME;</li>
<li> directory in which compilation is to take place;</li>
<li> name of C module minus the .c extension, e.g. "test" for test.c.</li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="cplus">Setting up a C++ compiler for use with JSim</a></h2>
<p>     JSim support for C++ is planned for the future,  but is not yet 
available.</p>
<h2>  <a name="fortran">Setting up a Fortran compiler for use with JSim</a></h2>
<p>     JSim support for Fortran is planned for the future,  but is not yet 
available.</p>
<h2>  <a name="matlab">Setting up Matlab for use with JSim</a></h2>
<p>     JSim support for Matlab is planned for the future,  but is not yet 
available.</p>
