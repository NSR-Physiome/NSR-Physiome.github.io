<h2><a name="tech">Compiler Overview</a></h2>

<p>Some technical understanding of the JSim compiler is helpful in 
understanding improvements in JSim version 2.0. The compiler consists 
of 8 phases, each of whose results feeds to the next.  The starting point 
is MML model text.  The end point is a JSim model run-time object or an 
appropriate error message. The compiler phases, in order of execution, are 
listed below.  Phases 4 through 7 were rewritten for version 2.0.  The JSim 
model run-time library (utilized by the runnable model object) has not been 
changed for initial release, although some changes will be rolled in in the 
coming months. </p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bug Fixes in version 2.0</a></h2>

<p><strong><a name="allseq">No more "Not all tools sequenced" error 
messages</a></strong>: This message in version 1.6 indicated that the 
sequencing phase failed to place all calculations in correct sequence. It 
was very frustrating to users because the compiler could not give the user 
specific information as to where the problem was. In most cases, the 
problem was in the compiler which made internal errors in formulating 
calculation dependencies.  These errors have been corrected in version 2.0.  
However, the message could also be caused by genuine circular dependencies 
in model calculations.  Version 2.0 contains algorithms to locate such 
circular dependencies and present them to the user.</p>

<p><strong><a name="impfind">Faster detection of underspecified models and 
implicit equations</a></strong>: In version 1.6, detection of implicit 
equation blocks was done via an inefficient and exhaustive search of the 
unprocessed equations. This could take minutes, or even hours, because a 
system of N equations contains N! possible implicit equation blocks.  In 
practice, blocks of more that 3 implicit equations were rarely found before 
the compilation timed out.  Even worse, every underspecified model made 
this search, meaning that underspecified models often had very long 
compilation times, and ended up needing to be canceled by the user.  
Version 2.0's implicit equation search is much more efficient and, by 
default, limits itself to 1,000,000 search blocks with a maximum block size 
of 10 equations.  Testing indicates this algorithm performs quickly and 
accurately for all known MML models, and should enable modelers to use more 
implicit equations in their models. Even better, this eliminates long 
compile times for underspecified models.  The user may tune the parameters 
of the implicit search in the case of models needing a larger search space. 
See also <a href="#impblock">Implicit block declarations in MML</a>.</p>
 
<p><strong><a name="block">Improved ODE & PDE blocking</a></strong>: In 
version 1.6,  ODEs and PDEs were blocked before they were sequenced.  
Version 2.0 performs blocking (phase 6) after sequencing (phase 5). This
eliminates one case of the <a href="#allseq">Not all tools sequenced</a> 
bug above.</p>

<p><strong><a name="museq">Improved microstep sequencing</a></strong>: In 
version 1.6, variables were sometimes calculated out of order within ODE 
microsteps.  This behaviour was inconsistent, but when it occured would 
result in numerical inaccuraccy, solver aborts or poor performance.  In a 
case study with Max Neal's VS001 model, calculations were made out of 
order, but numerical inaccuraccy was masked by the use of an adaptive ODE 
solver.  However the resulting numeric instability caused the solver to 
call the microstep routine about twice as many times, resulting in a 
doubling of calculation time.  This bug is fixed in version 2.0. </p>
 
<p><strong><a name="eventseq">Improved event sequencing</a></strong>: In 
version 1.6, events were sometimes sequenced out of order. 
This could force modelers to make obscure and seemingly arbitrary hacks to 
their models for them to run correctly. These problems have been fixed in 
version 2.0, however event sequencing remains a difficult and 
subtle subject.  More documentation on this will be forthcoming.</p>
 
<p><strong><a name="relseq">Improved relation 
sequencing</a></strong>: Relations can be used in MML to trigger error 
conditions so that worthless long model runs can be avoided.  In version 
1.6, the sequencing algorithm often placed relation tests well after the
calculation of a variable, blunting the effectiveness of the mechanism.
This has been corrected in version 2.0 where relations are now sequenced 
immediately after the relevant variable is calculated.</p>

<p><strong><a name="vfc">Improved VFC sequencing</a></strong>: Variable 
function calls (VFCs) are queries to the non-current value of a 
variable.  Two notable uses are for delay lines and data curve 
interpolation.  These two VFCs differ for sequencing purposes.  Delay 
VFCs may be calculated in the same loop as the source variable, while 
arbitrary query VFCs can only be calculated once the source variable is 
complete.  Version 1.6 did not attempt to distinguish these two cases, 
often resulting in VFCs returning NaNs.  Version 2.0 attempts to 
recognize delays, and sequence them within the same loop as their source 
variable.  VFC's not recognized as delays are attempted to be sequenced 
after the source variable loop is complete.  If this attempt results in 
a circular dependency, the VFC is sequenced as a delay and a warning 
message is issued to inform the user of the situation.</p>

<p><strong><a name="diag">Improved user diagnostics</a></strong>: 
Generating good error messages, especially for code as complicated as a 
language compiler, remains a bit of an art, and subject to continuous 
feedback and review.  In general, version 2.0 error messages were improved 
in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>A systematic review of all error messages was performed.</li>
<li>An attempt was made to distinguish internal compiler errors from errors
resulting from incorrectly written models.</li>
<li>An attempt was made to add line number information to more error 
messages.</li>
<li>Messages regarding circular sequence dependencies (see above) are now 
much more explicit.</li>
<li>Messages relating to underspecified and overspecified models remain 
difficult to interpret.  However, new <a href="#graph">model 
dependency graphs</a> are expected to be helpful in these cases.</li>
<li>Despite these efforts,  we expect users will still express confusion 
over some error messages.  We will continue to work to address these 
concerns.</li>
</ul>
 
<p><strong><a name="fastbug">Expedited bug resolution</a></strong>: The 
version 2.0 compiler have a more modular design and contain better internal 
workings auditing, in hopes of expediting resolution of future bugs.  The 
version 1.6 compiler had been hacked numerous times over the previous 9 
years, resulting in code that was exceedingly difficult and time-consuming 
to debug.  Our hope is that future bugs can be resolved much more quickly, 
but time will tell... </p>
 
<h2><a name="new">New Features in version 2.0</a></h2>

<p><strong><a name="mucache">Improved microstep caching</a></strong>: 
Version 2.0 does a better job of calculating ODE microstepped 
variables.  For example, under version 1.6,  variable <i>a</i> in the 
following model was not microstepped,  leading to less accurate 
numerical solution:</p>
 
<pre>
math main {
        realDomain t, x;
        t.min=0; t.max=3; t.delta=0.25;
        x.min=0; x.max=1; x.delta=0.1;
        real a(t) = t+1;
        real u(t,x);
        when (t=t.min) u=x;
        u:t = a + u;
}
</pre>

<p><strong><a name="event">Improved event sequencing</a></strong>: 
Multiple events in a model can create ambiguous calculation semantics.
Version 2 properly sequences unambiguous calculations, and 
issues warnings about ambiguous calculations.  Version 1 did 
not guarantee proper event sequencing and issued no 
warnings.


<p><strong><a name="odeorder">Nth order ODEs</a></strong>: Version 2.0 allows 
modelers to write Nth order ODEs directly in MML.  In version 1.6, modelers 
needed to explicitly reduce and Nth order ODE to N separate 1st order ODEs.

Example usage:</p>

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.max=2*PI; t.ct=13;
  real u(t);
  when (t=t.min) { u=1; u:t=0; }
  u:t:t = -u;  // 2nd order sinusoidal ODE 
}
</pre>
 
<p><strong><a name="odeevent">Events for ODE variables</a></strong>: Version 2.0 
allows events to affect ODE variables.  Under version 1.6,  events could 
only affect realState or intState variables.  Example usage: </p>

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.max=5; t.delta=.1;
  real u(t);
  when (t=t.min) u=1;
  u:t = -u;
  event (u<.2) u=1;
}
</pre>
 
<p><strong><a name="procic">Procedures may be used as initial 
conditions</a></strong>: In version 1.6, procedure calls within 
when clauses were not treated correctly.  This problem has been 
fixed in version 2.0.  Example usage:</p>

<pre>
source procedure double(a; b) {
        language="java";
        reentrant="true";
        maincode={{
            double aval = a.realVal();
            b.set(aval*2);
        }};
}

math main {
        realDomain t;
        t.min=0; t.max=3; t.delta=1;
        real u(t) = t+1;
        real v(t);
        when (t=t.min) double(u, v);
        v:t = -v;
}
</pre>

<p><strong><a name="when">More flexible initial condition and boundary 
condition specification</a></strong>: Under version 1.6, specification 
of initial and boundary conditions required a "when" clause.  When 
clauses are still supported under version 2.0, but modelers may 
alternatively use variable function calls (e.g. u(t.min)).  This change 
was made to support future PDE boundary conditions which equate left and 
right hand boundaries (e.g. u(x.max) = v(x.min)).  Example usage:</p>
 
<pre>
math main {
        realDomain t;
        t.min=0; t.max=3; t.delta=0.25;
        real u(t);
        u(t.min)=1;
        u:t = u;
}
</pre>

<p><strong><a name="domains">More flexible domain controls</a></strong>: 
Under version 1.6, for domain x, specification of domain controls x.min 
and x.max were required along with one of x.delta and x.ct.  Under 
version 2.0 any 3 domain controls is sufficient. Example usage:</p>

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.delta=3; t.ct=4;  // t.max=12 will be calculated
}
</pre>

<p>Also under version 2.0, some domain  controls may be left undefined.
In this case,  a warning message will be issued and
the user must specify the control before running the model. Example 
usage:</p>

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.delta=1; // t.max must be specified at run-time
}
</pre>
 
<p><strong><a name="xmml">XMML Output</a>:</strong> XMML is an XML 
representation of a JSim model, designed to export models to modeling 
and bioinformatics applications.  XMML is the underlying technology for 
<a href="#graph">JSim model graphs</a> and <a href="#sbmlout">SBML 
export</a>.  It is also used in Max Neal's SemSim application.  See
specification in <a href="MML_XMML.html">JSim XMML</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="graph">Model browser</a>:</strong> Version 2.0 
implements the model browser, a tool for exploring model structure 
visually via graphical representations of model dependencies.  Initially 
a very basic version of this concept will be available which be refined 
and improved upon in the coming months.  Browser graphs utilize <a 
href="#xmml">XMML</a> as a communcations medium.  In the JSim GUI, a 
model's browser may be found within the new "Browser" tab.  Thanks to 
Bart Jardine for the model graph implementation.  <a 
href="User_Browser.html">Browser documentation</a> is under 
development.</p>

<p><strong><a name="sbmlout">SBML Output</a>: </strong> Version 2.0 
allows you to output MML models as SBML.  Since SBML has a small 
mathematical vocabulary in comparison with MML, this feature works only 
for a subset of MML models (those with a single domain, ODEs, implicit 
equations and events).  SBML output utilizes <a href="#xmml">XMML</a> as 
a communcations medium. Further documentation of this feature may be 
found <a href="MML_SBML.html#export">here</a>. Thanks to Lucian Smith 
for the SBML output implementation. </p>

<p><strong><a name="trace">Improved variable tracing</a>: </strong> Version 2.0 
implements the -initNaN, -traceNaN, -abortNaN and -traceVars compiler switches in a 
more efficient way, and a time-point is now provided for microstepped 
calculation output.</p>

<p><strong><a name="integral">More consistent integrals</a>: </strong> 
In version 2.0, the short and long integral formulations are calculated 
via an interpolative procedure.  Previously, the short form was 
calculated via an interpolative procedure and the long form via a hidden 
ODE.  Thus I1 and I2 calculate the same under version 2, but not version 
1:

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.max=5; t.delta=1;
  real a(t) = t^2;
  real I1 = integral(a@t); // integral short form
  real I2 = integral(t=t.min to t.max, a); // integral long form
}
</pre>

<p>New documentation for integrals may be found <a 
href="MML_Integrals.html#integrals">here</a>.

<p><strong><a name="sum">More flexible sums</a>: </strong> 
Version 2 supports a long form of the sum function analagous
to the long form of the integral function:

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t;
  t.min=0; t.max=5; t.delta=1;
  real a(t) = t^2;
  real S(t) = sum(t=t.min to t, a);
}
</pre>

<p>New documentation for sums may be found <a 
href="MML_Integrals.html#sums">here</a>.



<h2><a name="coming">Coming Features in version 2.0</a></h2>

<p><strong><a name="statedim">N-dimensional state 
variables</a></strong>: Version 2.0 allows multi-domain realState and 
intState variables.  Under version 1.6, state variable had to be 
1-dimensional.  Example usage:</p>

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain t, x;
  t.min=0; t.max=10; t.delta=1;
  x.min=0; x.max=1; x.delta=.1;
  realState r(t,x);
  when(t=t.min) r=1;
  event(t>5) r=r+1;
}
</pre>

 
<p><strong><a name="sbmlevent">SBML-style events in MML</a></strong>: 
Historically, JSim events and SBML events have differed in their 
triggering semantics.  In JSim, an event is launched whenever its 
trigger expression evaluates to true.  In SBML, an event is launched 
when it trigger expression becomes true, i.e. on the "rising edge".  
In the next few months, MML syntax will be expanded to allow the user to 
designated events with rising edge trigger semantics.  At the same time, 
various other features of SBML events (delays, cancelable events, 
initial trigger values) will also be implemented.  These changes are 
made possible by fixes to basic event handling in version 2.0. </p>
 
<p><strong><a name="impblock">Implicit block declarations in 
MML</a></strong>: While version 2.0 has significantly improved 
detection of implicit equation blocks,  it remains an inherently 
difficult problem.  If modelers end up writing large number of 
implicit equations in their models,  it is possible that an explicit MML 
declaration will be needed for adequate compiler performance.  If 
so,  such a declaration might look something like for following:</p>

<pre>
... lots of model equations ...
implicit {
  a + b + c = 0;
  a^2 - c = 10;
  b + c = 5;
}
... lots more model equations ...
</pre>
 
<p><strong><a name="pdes">2D & 3D PDE solver support</a></strong>: The 
tooling and sequencing phases of the version 2.0 compiler now support 2D 
and 3D PDEs. In order to make such equations available to users, NSR 
will be implementing run-time numeric methods to solve such problems. As 
with current 1D PDE solvers, implementation of such methods will be an 
ongoing process in JSim development. </p>
 
<p><strong><a name="bettergraph">Improved model browser</a></strong>: 
The initial release of version 2.0 will include a fairly minimal 
implementation of the <a href="#graph">model browser</a>.  The 
graphs will be refined and improved based on user feedback as part of 
the ongoing process of JSim development.  Bart Jardine will be primarily 
responsible for this development.  Below are some example graphs from a 
prototype by Gary Yngve, which illustrate where we're headed: </p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="../pics/browser1.jpeg">example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="../pics/browser2.jpeg">example 2</a></li>
<li><a href="../pics/browser3.jpeg">example 3</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a name="sync">Synchronous run-time support</a></strong>: 
Currently, the JSim computational engine runs asynchronously from the 
user interface.  This methodology provides buffering for high 
performance.  However, there are some scenarios that would be better 
served by synchronous operation, that is, a lock step between the 
computational engine and user interface.  Now that underlying changes 
have been made in the version 2.0 compiler, it will now be possible to 
provide a synchronous run-time option, thus enabling three functionality 
targets: <a href="#sbw">improved SBW support</a>, <a 
href="#runvars">user modifiable run-time variables</a> and a <a 
href="#api">steppable API for joint JSim/CFD projects</a>. See 
below.</p>
 
<p><strong><a name="sbw">Improved SBW support</a></strong>: With a <a 
href="#sync">synchronous run-time</a> available JSim will be able to 
function within SBW as "simulator".  Currently, JSim functions in SBW 
only as an "analyzer".  Also, with <a href="#sbmlout">SBML output</a> 
available, JSim will also be able to function as an SBW "editor". </p>
 
<p><strong><a name="runvars">User modifiable run-time variables</a></strong>: 
With a <a href="#sync">synchronous run-time</a> available, it will be 
possible for users to modify some model variables during the course of a 
model run.  In particular,  time-variable inputs and ODE state variables 
should be modifiable.
</p>
 
<p><strong><a name="api">Steppable API for joint JSim/CFD 
projects</a></strong>: With a <a href="#sync">synchronous run-time</a> 
available, a synchronous API will allow program driven intra-run 
interaction with external programs.  In particular, this functionality 
will support joint JSim/CFD (computational fluid dynamics) models now 
under development. </p>

<h2><a name="knownbugs">Known bugs in version 2.0</a></h2>

<p>The following bugs are not yet resolved. However, we continue to work 
on them:</p>

<p>3 of 5000 tested models generate spurious error messages that
were not generated in version 1.</p>

<p>7 of 5000 tested models take a long time to compile - about 
90 seconds on the NSR server (gloin).</p>

<p>Event warnings are sometimes generated unnecessarily.  For
example,  the fibonacci calculation:

<pre>
math main {
  realDomain n;
  n.min=1; n.max=10; n.delta=1;
  intState f(n);
  when (n=n.min) f=1;
  event (n>2) f = f(n-1) + f(n-2);
}
