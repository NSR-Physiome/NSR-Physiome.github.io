<h1>MML Debugging Guide</h1>

<h2>  Introduction</h2>
<p>    This document suggests approaches for reasonably advanced MML model
writers to debugging some common problems with model compilation and run
results.  It is a rough guide that is expected to grow over time. It is
not meant to be encyclopedic. </p>

<h2>  <a name="units">Compiler aborts with unit compatibility errors</a></h2>
<p>    Such error messages are usually fairly specific about the offending
construct.  If there are questions about common standard unit definitions,
you may examine the common units file in $JSIMHOME/common/nsrunit.mod.  
Alternatively, this file may be viewed in a model's "Debug" tab in the
JSim GUI by selecting "View system units file" from the "View" menu. The
following facts about JSim unit correction are often a source of
confusion:</p>

<ol>
<li> Variables not explicitly assigned units at declaration time will be
assigned units based on equation context.  This is not the same as
declaring a variable dimensionless.  An error will result if the variable
is used in conflicting contexts, although the resulting cascade of
assignments may make the original error difficult to trace.  Assigning
units to some variables explicitly may help in diagnosis.</li>
<li> Transcendental functions (e.g. exp(), sin()) must take
dimensionless arguments and return dimensionless results.</li>
<li> The exponent of the power function must be dimensionless.</li>
<li> United variables may only be raised to constant powers.</li>
<li> integral() has units that are the product of the expression 
being integrated and the variable of integration.  sum() has the same
units as the expression being summed.</li>

</ol>
<h2>  <a name="fzero">Compilation takes a very long time</a></h2>
<p>    Model compilation times over about 30 seconds usually
result from the compiler attempting to solve a large number of 
simultaneous <a href="MML_Implicit.html">implicit equations</a> .  This may occur
because your model actually has such equations,  but more ofter occurs
because there are missing equations in your model.  One common cause
is missing initial conditions for ODE/PDE state variables.</p>
<h2>  <a name="nans">Mysterious NaNs appear in output results</a></h2>
<p>    NaN (Not A Number) is an IEEE standard for non-sensical numbers,
e.g. 0/0.  Some causes of NaN calculations include:</p>

<ol>
<li> MML code not protected from zero divides,  negative sqrt() 
arguments and the like.</li>
<li> Numerically unstable ODE/PDE equations being fed into adaptive
time-step solvers (e.g. radau).</li>
<li> Planning errors caused by unsupported use of <a 
href="MML_VarFunc.html">variable 
functions </a> .</li>
<li> Cancelled or aborted runs will leave NaNs in all variables
that had not yet been calculated.</li>

</ol>
<p>    Use the <a href="#planner">planner output</a> and/or <a href="#trace">trace switches</a>
can sometimes facilitate the diagnosis of such problems.</p>
<h2>  <a name="solvers">ODE/PDE solvers abort during run</a></h2>
<p>    If these aborts relate to NaNs,  see the item above.  If not,
the equations may be too sophisticated for the solvers and/or settings
you are using.  See the model "Solvers" page to see the various options
for which solvers are available.  The default solver settings are 
appropriate for many problems,  but not all.  Try different solvers
as see if they improve your results.</p>
<h2>  <a name="memory">Model run aborts with OutOfMemoryError</a></h2>
<p>    This problem may occur when running models that have very large 
numbers of variables,  or use very large time or spatial grids.  For
a more complete guide to dealing with such problems see 
<a href="User_Memory.html">here</a> .</p>
<h2>  <a name="planner">Planner Output</a></h2>
<p>    The JSim planner is that part of the JSim compiler that turns MML 
mathematical constructs into a specific sequence of calculations.  A
simple text representation of this sequence may be viewed in a model's
"Debug" tab in the JSim GUI by selecting "View plan text" within the 
"View" menu.  Examining this text can give the modeler insight into how
JSim is attempting to calculate the model and suggesting what the problem
is.</p>
<p>    In theory, the planner sequence is internally checked so that each
variable is calculated from previously calculated variables. In practice,
<a href="MML_VarFunc.html">variable functions</a> sometimes poses 
difficult
sequencing problems which the planner doesn't correctly solve.  This
results in NaN calculations, since variables are initialized to NaNs
before each model run.</p>

<h2>  <a name="trace">Trace Switches</a></h2>

<p>Debugging switches -trace, -traceNaN and -abortNaN are described in 
the <a href="Devel_Batch.html">Batch Processing Manual</a> .  The 
example below suggests an approach to tracing the appearance of NaNs in 
JSim output.</p>

<p>    Run jsbatch on your model/project using the -abortNaN switch.  This
will cause the model run to abort the first time a NaN is calculated,  
with an error text on the offending variable.  Use the JSim planner output
(above) to figure out which variables are used in calculating the NaN
occurance.  If it is still unclear what the problem is,  use the -trace
switch to trace those variables.  Repeat process until the problem is
found.</p>
